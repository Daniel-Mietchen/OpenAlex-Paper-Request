One broad strand of research characterises how risk emerges within the complex global system, using concepts like systemic risk, Anthropocene risk, synchronous failure, negative social tipping points, and polycrisis. Another focuses on possible worst-case outcomes, using concepts like global catastrophic risk (GCR), existential risk, and extinction risk. Despite their clear relevance to each other, connections between these two strands remain limited. Here we provide a simple conceptual framework which synthesises these research strands and shows how emergent properties of the global system contribute to the risk of global catastrophic outcomes. In particular, we show that much GCR stems from the interaction of hazards and vulnerabilities which arise endogenously within the global system, and how “systems thinking” and complex adaptive systems (CAS) theory can help illuminate this. We also highlight some unique challenges which systemic sources of GCR pose for risk assessment and mitigation, discuss insights for policy, and outline potential paths forward.",Global Energy and Sustainability Research; Infrastructure Resilience and Vulnerability Analysis

In contrast, ex-ante financial instruments, such as insurance and sovereign catastrophe risk pools, offer faster, more predictable funding while encouraging risk reduction and adaptation investments.Sovereign risk pools, such as the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF), African Risk Capacity (ARC), and Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative (PCRAFI), have proven valuable. However, they may not fully realize their financial resilience potential, as pooling within the same region can limit risk diversification. This presentation will introduce a method to design risk pools by maximizing diversification across countries regardless of region.

Research related to these concepts has tended to be siloed in terms of the study of specific threats and also in terms of how these are assumed to materialize; PBs attribute global catastrophes to slow-moving and potentially irreversible global changes, while GCRs focuses on cataclysmic short-term events. We argue that there is a need for a more unified approach to managing global long-term risks, which recognizes the complex and confounded nature of the interactions between PBs and GCRs. We highlight where the PB and GCR concepts overlap and outline these complexities using an example of public health, namely, pandemics and food insecurity.

Major shocks can arise from global catastrophic risks, such as abrupt sunlight reduction scenarios (e.g., nuclear war) or global catastrophic infrastructure loss (e.g., due to severe geomagnetic storms or a global pandemic). We use a network model to examine how these two scenarios could impact global food trade, focusing on wheat, maize, soybeans, and rice, accounting for about 60% of global calorie intake. Our findings indicate that an abrupt sunlight reduction scenario, with soot emissions equivalent to a major nuclear war between India and Pakistan (37 Tg), could severely disrupt trade, causing most countries to lose the vast majority of their food imports (50-100 % decrease), primarily due to the main exporting countries being heavily affected. Global catastrophic infrastructure loss of the same magnitude as the abrupt sunlight reduction has a more homogeneous distribution of yield declines, resulting in most countries losing up to half of their food imports (25-50 % decrease). Thus, our analysis shows that both scenarios could significantly impact the food trade. However, the abrupt sunlight reduction scenario is likely more disruptive than global catastrophic infrastructure loss regarding the effects of yield reductions on food trade.

In this article, I explore the case for long‐term liberalism: freedom should be a central goal, and we should often be particularly concerned with effects on long‐term future distributions of freedom. I provide three arguments. First, liberals should be long‐term liberals: liberal arguments to value freedom give us reason to be (particularly) concerned with future freedom, including freedom in the far future. Second, longtermists should be liberals, particularly under conditions of empirical and moral uncertainty. Third, long‐term liberalism plausibly justifies some restrictions on the freedom of existing people to secure the freedom of future people, for example when mitigating climate change. At the same time, it likely avoids excessive trade‐offs: for both empirical and philosophical reasons, long‐term and near‐term freedom show significant convergence.

H. Luo,,True,gold,https://doi.org/10.2196/64940,"Background Previous studies on public compliance with policies during pandemics have primarily explained it from the perspectives of motivation theory, focusing on normative motivation (trust in policy-making institutions) and calculative motivation (fear of contracting the disease). However, the social amplification of a risk framework highlights that the media plays a key role in this process. Objective This study aims to integrate the motivation theory of compliance behavior and the social amplification of risk framework to uncover the “black boxes” of the mechanisms by which normative motivation and calculative motivation influence public policy compliance behavior through the use of media. Methods During the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a web-based survey of 2309 Chinese citizens from December 4, 2022, to March 21, 2023. We treated the public’s policy compliance behavior during the pandemic as the dependent variable. Media use, specifically the use of authoritative media and “we-media,” that is, personal social media accounts and media platforms operated by individuals, was set as the independent variable. Trust in government, representing normative motivation, and risk perception, representing calculative motivation, were included as mediating variables. A structural equation model was constructed and analyzed using Stata. Results First, the mediation effect of trust in government indicates that the use of authoritative media can enhance trust in government, which significantly increases individuals’ policy compliance behavior (β coefficient=0.108, 95% CI 0.080-0.135; P&lt;.001). Second, the mediation effect of risk perception shows that the use of we-media heightened individual risk perception, thereby significantly enhancing policy compliance behavior (β coefficient=0.012, 95% CI 0.002-0.021; P=.02). Third, the study revealed the “paradox of trust”: the chain mediation effect in which authoritative media increased trust in government and reduced risk perception, ultimately decreasing policy compliance behavior (β coefficient=–0.005, 95% CI –0.009 to –0.001; P=.008). Conclusions By combining the motivation theory of compliance behavior with the social amplification of risk framework in risk communication, we found that trust in government, as a normative motivation, operates through authoritative media, while risk perception, as a calculative motivation, promotes compliance behavior through we-media. In addition, in major crises, the public’s use of authoritative media can lead to the paradox of trust: on the one hand, trust in the government increases policy compliance; on the other hand, this trust reduces risk perception, thereby decreasing compliance behavior. Authoritative institutions need to balance providing authoritative information with maintaining the public’s risk perception.",Misinformation and Its Impacts; Disaster Management and Resilience; Social Media and Politics

Jacobs, a US-born professor at the Hiroshima Peace Institute of Hiroshima City University, offers a radical reinterpretation of the nuclear age. The book is based on his work (with Mick Broderick of Murdoch University) on the Global Hibakusha Project. Departing from conventional analyses that silo nuclear events by type and nation, Nuclear Bodies centers the experiences of ""global hibakushas"": all who have suffered the radiological effects of nuclear technologies since 1945. Foregrounding the bodies of global hibakushas as inextricably linked to land, communities, and ecosystems, Jacobs argues that the ongoing suffering of these victims, marked by early mortality, disease, and displacement, constitutes a ""limited nuclear war,"" even in the absence of overt weapon use. By examining in detail how this human-made, slow-moving disaster unfolded in colonial, postcolonial, or remote parts of the world, he demonstrates how its victims remain largely invisible due to their subaltern status. Through a synthesis of extensive research, including original fieldwork in radiation-inflicted communities, Jacobs has produced a truly global, decolonized history of the nuclear age. The first four chapters of the book meticulously document the devastating consequences of nuclear activities worldwide. Two key insights emerge. First, the book critically examines the role of science and medicine in concealing the suffering of global hibakushas. Chapter 1 examines how the Life Span Study (LSS) with atomic bomb survivors was constructed with an exclusive focus on external radiation from sources outside of the body. This research, however, did not account for internal exposures resulting from the inhalation or ingestion of radioactive particles. While some have attributed malicious intent to the study design, Jacobs argues that ""the truth is more mundane: the impact of external radiation was more pressing in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and importantly, quantifying internal exposures was simply hard science to do"" (41). As Chapter 4 demonstrates, the problem was rather that the LSS was subsequently ""weaponized"" by public officials, utility managers, and scientific experts worldwide to dismiss and obscure the potential health effects of living in environments contaminated with radionuclides. The LSS thus has played a key role in the invisibility of most, if not all, global hibakushas since Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Second, the book goes beyond the physical toll of affected communities, emphasizing how radioactive contamination unravels their social, cultural, and ecological fabric. For instance, the forced displacement of the Pitjantjatjara people in South Australia and the Marshallese in the Pacific led to the loss of traditional knowledge about and connections to their homelands. Returning to contaminated environments often brings health anxieties and social fragmentation, leading to perpetual dependency on the very entities responsible for their suffering for work, food, and medical care. However, these emotional and psychological effects, like the impacts of internal exposures, are often dismissed as irrational and self-inflicted. As Jacobs argues, ""Reducing people and cultures to data points that can be displaced as authorities dictate, whose communities—embedded in traditional cultural and ecosystems—are separable from their health outcomes and subordinate to state liability management, is structural violence"" (103). The last three chapters of the book zero in on the mechanisms of violence that have produced millions of these global hibakushas while keeping their suffering invisible. Chapter 5 demonstrates how nuclear colonialism drove the selection of nuclear test sites at the margins of nations or empires. A wide range of geographically, racially, and socioeconomically marginalized communities, from Mormons to Muslims, Polynesians to Nenets, were systematically targeted as nuclear dumping grounds due to their subaltern status. Chapter 6 fully develops the notion of limited nuclear war. Invoking Emmanuel Kreike's notion of environcide, Jacobs argues that nuclear weapons testing constituted a form of limited nuclear war due to the wholesale and indiscriminate contamination of the living environment worldwide. Yet, as he notes, the specter of an all-out nuclear war during the Cold War cloaked this violence by creating a ""'Bizarro World' dynamic in which it made more sense to nuclear weapon states to harm populations under their own care"" (185). Chapter 7 concludes the book by scrutinizing the notion of competence in nuclear management. While the nonuse of nuclear weapons and the infrequency of reactor meltdowns might suggest a degree of success in managing nuclear technologies, Jacobs sees incompetence everywhere. Aside from minor accidents and near misses, he highlights the limitations of risk assessments in fully accounting for internal exposures and systems complexity. Moreover, the disposal of nuclear waste exemplifies a form of ""temporal violence,"" where the burden of long-term toxicity is transferred to future generations with no benefit or consent. Of the book's many virtues, two stand out. First, it provides a sophisticated and multifaceted analysis of violence. Transcending the traditional focus on overt warfare, Jacobs expands the notion of violence to encompass the slow, insidious effects of nuclear technologies on human health, the environment, and societies. Second, the book masterfully employs the power of juxtaposition in historical analysis. Jacobs examines the experience of diverse radiation-inflicted communities side by side, revealing the interconnectedness and shared experiences of global hibakushas as well as the same forces of nuclear colonialism in concealing their suffering. Deeply researched, powerfully argued, and elegantly written, Nuclear Bodies serves as a stark reminder about the global and enduring consequences of nuclear technologies. As Jacobs observes, the damage has already been done, and we must commit ourselves to responsible stewardship of existing nuclear waste. However, as he emphasizes, ""The most important thing we must do is to stop making more nuclear waste: we must abolish nuclear weapons and abandon nuclear power"" (xii–xiii). Undoubtedly controversial, this powerful statement nevertheless serves as a call to action, urging us to break the chain of violence that continues to produce global hibakushas and to strive for a world free from the pain and agony inflicted by nuclear technologies.

This paper examines two common concerns: that genetic enhancement may create biologically distinct “superhumans” who might outcompete ordinary humans or cause a societal collapse, and that modifying the human genome might “disrupt human nature”, leading to the loss of our humanness. While these concerns appear distinct, both ultimately fear that genome editing may create individuals who can no longer be identified as “human” endangering humanity as we know it, and thus both view genome editing as an existential threat. This paper critically evaluates these concerns by examining the feasibility of the envisioned scenarios, arguing that the emergence of a distinct superhuman species is highly unlikely as it would require reproductive isolation achievable only through strictly controlled reproduction, while the emergence of people with enhanced traits might not necessarily convert into a societal catastrophe. Likewise, human nature is unlikely to be fundamentally altered by genome editing without extreme reproductive control, while the genome alone does not define human nature that has significantly evolved throughout human history. Since both feared scenarios would require a dystopian level of reproductive control rather than the mere availability of genome editing, I conclude by discussing the use of extreme totalitarian scenarios in guiding genome editing policy. This paper contributes to the debate on human genetic enhancement by challenging two common existential concerns and advocating for evidence-based ethical and policy deliberations.","Geographies of human-animal interactions; Race, Genetics, and Society; Space Science and Extraterrestrial Life"

According to the authors, this type of fear is acceptable for police personnel, the specifics of the service of whose employees, despite the high risk of their law enforcement mission, does not imply the unconditional direct participation of each policeman in the conduct of hostilities in war or in the format of a military conflict. The practical and scientific importance of studying current methods designed for a more in-depth study of fear is noted. Attention is focused on the correlation of fear and the role of socialization of the police in the general system of perception of the threat of war and military conflict by the population of the country. The absence of an array of modern ideas on this issue is stated. The purpose of the study is to substantiate the problem of fear of modern war and the possibility of using existing techniques to diagnose the specified emotional state of police personnel. The above is the novelty of the completed research. The methodological basis of the study was a systematic approach. Theoretical information is presented regarding the typology of personality behavior patterns, the formation of which is caused by a state of fear, and their psychological basis is fully acceptable for the personality of a police officer. The scope of the results is to minimize the level of mental tension of police personnel.",Emotional Intelligence and Performance; Personality Traits and Psychology

A nuclear war or volcanic eruption could collapse agricultural yields by inhibiting crop growth. Nuclear electromagnetic pulses or extreme pandemics could disrupt industry and mass-scale food supply by unprecedented levels. Global food storage is limited. What can be done?. This article presents the state of the field on interventions to maintain food production in these scenarios, aiming to prevent mass starvation and reduce the chance of civilizational collapse and potential existential catastrophe. The potential for rapid scaling, affordability, and large-scale deployment is reviewed for a portfolio of food production methods over land, water, and industrial systems. Special focus is given to proposing avenues for further research and technology development and to collating policy proposals. Maintaining international trade and prioritizing crops for food instead of animal feed or biofuels is paramount. Both mature, proven methods (crop relocation, plant-residue- and grass–fed ruminants, greenhouses, seaweed, fishing, etc.) and novel resilient foods are characterized. A future research agenda is outlined, including scenario characterization, policy development, production ramp-up and economic analyses, and rapid deployment trials. Governments could implement national plans and task forces to address extreme food system risks, and invest in resilient food solutions to safeguard citizens against global catastrophic food failure.","Nuclear Issues and Defense; Environmental, Ecological, and Cultural Studies; Nuclear and radioactivity studies"

As climate change perceptions are crucial for individual risk management, adaptation, and collective climate actions, it is vital to explore how these perceptions are shaped. Given the increasing significance of social media in climate change discourse, this study employs survey data from the 2021 Environmental Risk Perceptions and Environmental Behaviors of Urban Residents Project to investigate how social media exposure influences risk perceptions of climate change among the Chinese public. Drawing on the social amplification of risk framework, this study examines the effect of exposure to environmental information, exposure to opinion diversity, individuals' social media network ties to environmental opinion leaders, and the interaction between social media exposure and cultural values. The results indicate that in the contexts where climate change is neither politically divisive nor openly debated, social media exposure to diverse opinions and social media network ties to environmental scholars positively predict risk perceptions. Additionally, egalitarianism and fatalism are found to moderate the effect of these connections with environmental scholars. This study extends previous research, which focuses largely on the association between the frequency of social media exposure and risk perceptions of climate change, by revealing a more comprehensive and nuanced process that links social media exposure to climate change perceptions.",Climate Change Communication and Perception; Risk Perception and Management; Environmental Education and Sustainability

The purpose of the article is primarily to share information about the birth and development history of the Finnish civil defence system. Design/methodology/approach The study is a literary study, including the stages of legislative preparation. The research data is analysed using path dependency theory. The study uses path dependency theory to analyse the development of civil defence shelter construction. Findings The paper provides empirical picture about how the development of construction of civil defence shelters was started by voluntary basis and then development was stipulated by legislation. Path dependency can be used to explain how previous investments in infrastructure or technology have affected decision-making. The technical system of shelters was preserved in terms of conventional pressure protection and developed through changes in the socio-economic system as well as by the threat of nuclear war. Research limitations/implications The study describes solely development of Finnish civil defence shelter concept. There is a need for a separate international comparative study of developments in different countries and international strategies for civil defence. Practical implications The paper reviews the step-by-step development of Finnish civil defence shelters over time, including legislation and technical standards, highlighting the importance of civil defence shelters. Originality/value Several Finnish-language studies have been published on the historical development of the construction of Finnish civil defence shelters, but the internationally published unified historical review has not previously been published.

After World War II came to an end, Christian hopes for a post-war spiritual renewal led to a significant resurgence of religion in the West. The trauma of division and oppression, as well as the fear of a devastating international nuclear war, resulted in a particular enthusiasm for spirituality. Transnational pilgrimages and similar religious gatherings thrived. In addition, largely as a result of Pius XII's promotion of Catholic Action, the participation and mobility of Catholics in national and international forums (including the UN) increased. One particularly interesting case study is the 1952 International Eucharistic Congress (IEC) in Barcelona. The gathering was organized by a formerly Axis-aligned dictatorship: Franco's Spain. In the late 1940s, the country had been condemned to diplomatic isolation due to its wartime ties with the Axis powers. It was also subject to strict curtailments imposed on the internal circulation of goods, people, and ideas. Consequently, organizing the Congress posed considerable challenges for the regime, including the regulation of attendance by determining who was permitted to participate (i.e. pilgrims, refugees) and who was barred (i.e. migrants). In the end, the Congress brought together nearly two million faithful Catholics from all over the world. As a mass international event and an example of ‘religion in motion’ (Hervieu-Léger, 1999), the Barcelona IEC offers a significant opportunity to advance and nuance the historical understanding of the powerful local and international mobilities that have played a role in shaping the contemporary world.",Religious Tourism and Spaces

Budescu; Philip E. Tetlock,IE University,False,closed,,"High-stakes debates often pivot on clashing estimates of outcomes that one side sees as so improbable as not to deserve policy prioritization. These debates are especially intractable when they focus on rare events ranging from disasters (e.g., existential risks from Artificial Intelligence, nuclear war, or bioengineered pandemics) to surprising successes (e.g., once inconceivable scientific discoveries). The research literature offers grounds for suspecting that the micro-probability judgments flowing into such debates are both unreliable and biased. This article covers experimental manipulations that achieve improvements in accuracy for low-probability judgments by shifting from the standard linear elicitation scale and Brier scoring rule to nonlinear (logarithmic) elicitation scales and logarithmic scoring rules. These methodological changes produced accuracy improvements of approximately d = 0.2 to 0.5 for individual accuracy scores. Improvements in aggregate accuracy varied more widely by aggregation function (mean vs. median) and accuracy scoring rule, between parity (d = 0) and a large advantage for non-linear over linear scales (d = 0.68). Judgments obtained via the linear scale and text box elicitations systematically overestimated the true values. New scales allowed forecasters to provide precise judgments at the low end of the probability scale and logarithmic scoring rules penalize large errors harshly, incentivising judges to avoid 0%and provide precise non-zero probabilities. An indirect elicitation protocol we developed, successive menus, yielded mixed results, such as improving aggregate accuracy and individual calibration at the cost of increasing outlier judgments and reducing retention. Base rate anchors provided context but no measurable accuracy benefits. These results point to next steps for improving probability judgments of rare events. The most promising next steps include a) using subject-specific Base-Rate Anchors, b) developing training programs specific to low-probability events, c) developing more robust and usable indirect elicitation protocols, and d) assessing all of these methods in longitudinal forecasting tournament featuring many forecasting questions focused on rare events.",Forecasting Techniques and Applications

Patil; Stefan Hochrainer‐Stigler,,False,closed,,"Despite wide-spread recognition and rhetoric regarding the burdens imposed by simple and systemic disaster and climate risks as well as solid evidence regarding the benefits of reducing risk, it has remained difficult to motivate sustained investment into disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA) at individual project level as well as country scale. To this effect, international policy debate over the last years in the wake of the international compacts of 2015 has emphasized the need for orienting such investments toward interventions that generate so-called triple or multiple resilience dividends. Such dividends include reducing loss of lives and livelihoods, unlocking development, and creating development co-benefits. In addition to risk reduction benefits from project investment (1st dividend), these suggested dividends would arise from positive externalities, such as unlocked development (2nd dividend) and co-benefits (3rd dividend), e.g. investment into health systems with returns from treating disaster-affected patients and those affected by idiosyncratic events, such as from disease or accidents. In economic parlance, externalities (also called spill-overs) can be considered the benefits (if positive) or costs (if negative) not directly captured in market prices or transactions. In our discussion, we consider externalities as the unplanned positive or negative effects arising from risk management investment. While externalities have been considered in sustainability decision-making for public sector investment decisions for many issues, in DRR and CCA they are generally not yet well captured, which gave rise to the concept of triple dividend decision-making propositions.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;Yet, while triple and multi resilience dividend decision-making have received attention in policy and practice over the last decade, evidence remains scarce, particularly as to the 2nd dividend (the externalities). We suggest that systemic risk research with its focus on interdependent systems coupled with resilience dividend decision-making reasoning may point a way forward for improved decision-making on disaster and climate risks (reduction).&amp;#160;This article queries what resilience assessment methods, metrics and evidence exist to address interconnected systemic and global catastrophic risks for informing efforts towards transformational resilience across systems.&amp;#160;Based on insights and examples&amp;#160;from decision-making analysis as well as systemic risk research we show&amp;#160;how analysts and decision-makers can better consider the various resilience dividends, i.e., positive externalities and co-benefits of disaster risk reduction measures beyond the reduction of losses and assess dependencies in risk and benefits' creation across micro and macro scales. As we suggest, this may enable a more comprehensive evaluation of interventions with benefits arising at various scales, thus in many cases, where there are strong dependencies across systems, such benefits may result in reduced cost (trade-offs) and increased benefits (or synergies) for risk reduction and resilience.&amp;#160;",Insurance and Financial Risk Management

The System Dynamics (SD) community has spent decades examining the complexity of global issues and responding to the ensuing risks—from the limits to growth (Herrington, 2021; Nature, 2022) and climate change (Rooney-Varga et al., 2021; Sterman, 2008) to the opioid crises (Jalali et al., 2020; Nataraj et al., 2024), poverty (Herrera de Leon & Kopainsky, 2019), and violent conflicts (Clancy et al., 2024). However, today's crises feel different. What has changed? The answer lies in the emergence of what scholars today call the polycrisis. At the core of the concept is the intuition that what may appear to be separate crises in different systems in fact interact and reshape one another in ways that compound their harms yet remain underappreciated in policy and analysis. Definitions vary (see Matlovič & Matlovičová, 2024), but virtually all of them adopt a systems perspective as the essential foundation of the concept. Polycrisis thinkers maintain that the polycrisis as a whole is both different, and generally worse, than the sum of its constituent crises, thus constituting an emergent phenomenon (e.g., World Economic Forum, 2023). They recognize the interactions between multiple causes working in complex patterns (such as feedback loops) to generate crises, while others continue to offer reductionist explanations (e.g., Tooze, 2022). And polycrisis thinkers emphasize nonlinear dynamics and unpredictability of the systems in which crises occur—properties that defy conventional risk analysis and traditional policymaking approaches (Davies & Hobson, 2023). One particular approach understands a crisis as the harmful disequilibrium that occurs when long-term stresses and more proximate trigger interact to push a system out of its established basin of attraction (Lawrence, Homer-Dixon, Janzwood, et al., 2024). The resonance of polycrisis thinking with the SD community's concerns is readily evident. To pursue these intersections would not just seize a promising opportunity, it is an urgent imperative that could help the world navigate the world's precarious and unprecedented condition (Homer-Dixon, 2023). To aid the collaboration, members of the polycrisis community set out a productive, practicable, and stimulating agenda for research and action in May 2024. Many of the priorities articulated in Polycrisis Research and Action Roadmap can and should be taken up by the SD community (the roadmap is co-authored by the Cascade Institute, the Potsdam Institute for Climate Action Research (PIK), the Research Institute for Sustainability/Helmholtz Centre Potsdam, and the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk (CSER) at Cambridge University) (Lawrence, Shipman, et al., 2024). First, in terms of theoretical foundations, researchers and practitioners should be more explicit about their positions about the nature of the polycrisis, the level of crises' interactions sufficient to qualify as a polycrisis and the concepts of risk and crisis (SD has a deep-rooted epistemology based on operationalizing and making mental models explicit). Second, regarding empirical research, there is a compelling call to more clearly identify the systems under investigation and the boundaries of those systems, along with the mechanisms behind crisis spread and contagion (the tools and approaches within the SD community have largely debated the boundaries of models and diffusion mechanisms in several fields). Third, as for practical applications, policymakers and other frontline stakeholders are excluded from the polycrisis research process, often as the result of a ""negativity bias"" within the field that limits reach (SD has long been applied to understand and address wicked problems with a perceived strong ""negative"" bias and the SD community has developed many innovative group-based and participatory modeling processes). Fourth, in terms of community building, the development of a polycrisis field requires a unified identity that represents diverse perspectives and fosters cooperation, along with the organizational infrastructure to support communication and collaboration (the SD community sets an excellent benchmark with the System Dynamics Society and the System Dynamics Review). With those four dimensions in mind, we put forth a set of five key features of the overarching SD approach and academic community that makes it uniquely positioned to make significant contributions to the emerging field of polycrisis analysis. One approach to polycrisis analysis is the stress–trigger–crisis (STC) model, where slow-moving systemic stresses (e.g., climate change or socioeconomic inequality) interact with fast-moving trigger events (e.g., financial collapses or pandemics) to push global systems into disequilibrium (Lawrence, Shipman, & Homer-Dixon, 2024). What makes polycrisis particularly dangerous is the feedback loops between these stresses and trigger events. For instance, a pandemic might worsen socioeconomic inequality, which in turn undermines public health systems, creating conditions for future health crises. These feedback loops can be explained by modeling how crises in one system can intensify or trigger crises in others based on a fundamental ""endogenous point of view"", which George Richardson calls the sine qua non of systems approaches (Richardson, 2011). SD can offer critical insights into how we might break dangerous loops of crisis amplification and develop more resilient systems. The unpredictability of polycrisis is one of its defining features, as the precise timing and location of trigger events are difficult to forecast. Within this context, SD offers tools to support scenario analysis, allowing us to simulate how different patterns of behavior might emerge. Inter-systemic feedback diagrams (Lawrence, Shipman, & Homer-Dixon, 2024), for example, depict how stressors in one domain, such as climate heating, can lead to cascading effects in other domains, such as pandemics and economic crises. The SD community can then further provide decision-makers with tools to anticipate and mitigate the potential impacts of future crises. This type of scenario analysis is essential for policymakers trying to navigate a world of profound uncertainty. Polycrisis analysis is inherently interdisciplinary, requiring insights from fields as diverse as environmental science, political economy, public health, and international relations. One of the strengths of SD is its ability to integrate knowledge from multiple domains into coherent models. SD can support the development of comprehensive models that capture the interactions between various systems in crisis. For example, the STC model emphasizes how systemic stresses slowly erode a system's equilibrium, while trigger events push the system into disequilibrium. As system dynamicists, we can play a vital role in refining these models, using our tools to better map out the complex causal pathways that define the polycrisis. A key challenge of polycrisis analysis is the sheer complexity of the interactions between crises. Policymakers, faced with a flood of data and (mis)information, often struggle to entirely grasp the full extent of the interconnections between crises in different systems. This is where SD can provide decision support tools, helping policymakers understand how interventions in one system might ripple through others, producing unintended consequences. The domino diagrams used to map the intersection between systemic risks in recent polycrisis analysis (see Lawrence, Shipman, & Homer-Dixon, 2024) offer a powerful metaphor, as they illustrate how a trigger event in one system (e.g., a spike in energy prices) can cause cascading failures across others (e.g., food shortages, economic instability). SD models can extend these metaphors, offering policymakers tangible simulations of how actions seemingly focusing on one area—such as implementing climate policies or regulating financial markets—can have wide-ranging impacts. We can make use of our long tradition of management flight simulators and serious games, such as the En-ROADS global climate simulator, to respond to these demands (Kapmeier et al., 2021). Finally, as polycrisis typically pushes systems into states of disequilibrium, the system's usual feedback mechanisms might break down or change nature, leading to unpredictable and potentially catastrophic outcomes. SD can help map out the possible transitions back to stability, identifying pathways that minimize harm. When systems are forced out of equilibrium, they may enter periods of volatility and disruption, frequently resulting in cascading harms. SD models can offer insights into how we might navigate these periods of disequilibrium, by identifying the leverage and intervention points that can either stabilize the system or push it into a new, more sustainable equilibrium. The polycrisis is here, and the SD community has the tools to make a difference. By embracing polycrisis analysis, we can extend our tradition of tackling the world's most pressing challenges and contribute to building a more resilient, just, and sustainable global system. It is time for system dynamicists to collaborate with experts across disciplines, to refine our models of complex crises, and to offer decision-makers the tools they need to navigate an uncertain and turbulent world. Together, we can help unravel the polycrisis. The authors have no organizations or individuals to acknowledge.

In 1954, nine years after the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Pope Pius XII delivered what at the time was the most precise statement of the Catholic Church's view of nuclear weapons. In an address to the Congress of the World Medical Association, the Pope stated that ""modern all-out warfare,"" or so-called ABC warfare (atomic, biological, and chemical), could only be permitted when it was absolutely necessary as a means of justified self-defense. Moreover, Pius explained, ""should the use of this method entail such an extension of the existing evil as would render man wholly incapable of controlling it, its use should be rejected as immoral."" Controllability, then—a technical, not moral term—became the primary criterion through which Catholic theologians began to judge the morality of nuclear weapons. As a result, despite Pope John XXIII's demand in the wake of the Cuban Missile Crisis that ""true and solid peace of nations consists not in equality of arms but in mutual trust alone,"" when the Second Vatican Council opened its third session in the fall of 1964, the debate over nuclear weapons centered largely around whether such weapons could be reasonably regulated. Those bishops defending the US Cold War policy of nuclear deterrence—particularly the bishops from the United States—turned to military experts who claimed that such weapons were in fact very precise and controllable and that their destructive impact could therefore be limited. All of this changed, however, when John Taylor, the bishop of Stockholm, submitted an intervention before the Council which argued that the natural moral order condemned the use of nuclear weapons ""which strike indiscriminately at combatants and non-combatants, soldiers and civilians."" This became a crucial distinction. Taylor's substitution of the technical term ""controllability"" for the moral term ""discrimination"" enabled the Council to condemn modern total war with the language of traditional Catholic moral theology in a way that could be understood as referring directly to nuclear weapons. In short, rather than deferring to military specialists and weapons experts, Taylor empowered his fellow bishops to speak with more confidence and authority on the morality of nuclear weapons. Such confidence and authority are clearly on display in the US Catholic bishops' 1983 pastoral letter The Challenge of Peace, in which they stated that use of nuclear weapons would be immoral. However, they also granted a ""strictly conditioned moral acceptance"" of the US policy of nuclear deterrence—a policy that was justified as long as progress toward disarmament was moving forward. In this, the bishops followed the lead of Pope John Paul II's ""interim ethic"" statement on nuclear deterrence to the United Nations in 1982. Neither the US bishops nor the Pope, however, offered any timeline for such disarmament. That changed in 2017 when the Holy See became the first state to sign and ratify the UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. At a Vatican Symposium later that year, Pope Francis condemned not only the deployment and the use of nuclear weapons but also their possession. In short, the Pope put an end to the Church's ""strictly conditioned moral acceptance"" of nuclear deterrence because the conditions for such acceptance had not been met. All of this history is important for understanding the two volumes under review here. The first, A World Free from Nuclear Weapons: The Vatican Conference on Disarmament, edited by Carole Sargent and the late Drew Christiansen, SJ, includes the proceedings of the 2017 Vatican symposium. The volume is broken into seven parts. The first, ""Setting the Agenda,"" includes Pope Francis's historic statement on nuclear weapons, as well as a statement from Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the secretary of state for the Holy See in which he introduces the concept of ""integral disarmament""—building on the idea of ""integral ecology"" from Pope Francis's 2013 environmental encyclical Laudato Si'. Part two, ""Witnesses,"" opens with an account from Masako Wada, the assistant secretary-general of the Japan Conference of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organization. This is followed by a statement by Bruno Müller, an executive at Mazda Motors, on the rebuilding of the company's hometown of Hiroshima. Part three, ""Laureates,"" includes letters to Pope Francis written in conjunction with the symposium by various Nobel Peace Prize recipients. These include Mohamed ElBaradei of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Argentinian human rights activist Adolfo Pérez Esquivel, and Muhammad Yunus from the Grameen Bank. Included as well are letters from Beatrice Fihn of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN); Jody Williams, a leader of the international campaign to ban land mines; and Irish peace activist Mairead Corrigan Maguire. The fourth part, ""Diplomats,"" begins with a ""debate"" between Jorge Lomónaco (Mexico) and Thomas Hajnoczi (Austria), two diplomats who played a pivotal role in the adoption of the UN treaty prohibiting nuclear weapons, along with Rose Gottemoeller (USA) from NATO. This section also includes papers from Alexei Georgevich Arbatov (Russia) of the Center for International Security at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations, and Izumi Nakamitsu, the UN representative for disarmament affairs in Japan. A paper by Thomas Stelzer, the Austrian ambassador to Portugal, closes out this part. In the fifth section, ""International Civil Society,"" papers from figures mainly representing nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are highlighted. These include François Bugnion from the International Committee of the Red Cross and Susi Snyder from PAX. Marie-Noëlle Koyara, the minister of state for defense of the Central African Republic, offers the volume's lone military perspective. This section is rounded out with statements from Paolo Cotta-Ramusino of the Pugwash Conference on Science and World Affairs (which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1995), Emily Landau from the Institute for National Security Studies and the Arms Control and Regional Security Program in Israel, and Ayman Khalil, director of the Arab Institute for Security Studies in Jordan. Cardinal Robert McElroy of the Diocese of San Diego (recently appointed Archbishop of Washington, DC) opens the sixth part titled ""More Religious Voices."" This is followed by papers from Hiromasa Ikeda of Soka Gakkai International, a Japanese religious NGO, and Monica Attias from the Community of Sant'Egidio, a Catholic lay movement known for its peace activism. Papers by Drew Christiansen and Stephen Colecchi from the US Catholic Conference of Bishops end the section. The volume concludes with a closing statement to the symposium by Cardinal Peter K.A. Turkson and an Afterword by Archbishop Silvano Tomasi, the Vatican's point person on nuclear disarmament. The second volume, Forbidden: Receiving Pope Francis's Condemnation of Nuclear Weapons, is also edited by Sargent and Christiansen. Sargent is director of Georgetown University's Office of Scholarly Publications. Christiansen was a Jesuit priest and a widely published professor of Catholic moral theology, most recently at Georgetown, who passed away in April 2022 just as this volume was nearing completion. It contains 32 essays of varying lengths and points of view, although all seem to support Pope Francis's basic points. As in the preceding volume, the book is divided into sections, eight in all. Part One explains ""How We Got Here."" In it, William Werpehowski charts the shift in the argument from nuclear deterrence to abolition. Tobias Winright then argues that this shift was justified by the strict just-war approach taken by Catholic philosopher Elizabeth Anscombe in the 1960s. Gregory Reichberg contends that the philosophical defense of nuclear deterrence strategy based on the principle of double-effect—a hallmark of Catholic moral theology—fails. And William Barbieri concludes the section by applying the new moral landscape set forth in Laudato Si′ to the nuclear crisis. Part Two, ""Witnesses,"" identifies people calling for nuclear abolition. David Cortright describes ""nuclear realists"" such as George Shultz, Sam Nunn, and Henry Kissinger, whereas Daniel Hall's chapter highlights the ""hibakusha"" who survived the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. And then, the anti-nuclear weapons protestors in the Plowshares Movement are held up in an essay by Carole Sargent. Part Three points us ""Toward a World Without Nuclear Weapons,"" with James Goodby mapping shifts in attitudes toward these weapons. David Koplow then underscores the need to link constitutional and international law on nuclear weapons. Along similar lines, Pierce Corden highlights the need to link the disarmament of nuclear weapons with the elimination of conventional weapons. Richard Love points to new models of cooperation in stemming nuclear proliferation. And Lawrence Korb warns of the financial costs that another round of modernizing existing weapons systems would bring. In the fourth part, the ""Evolution of Just War"" is traced in several respects. For instance, Gerard Powers describes the shift from a ""utopian"" vision of disarmament to what he sees as a more realist vision. In their respective essays, Maryann Cusimano Love highlights the emergence of the ""just-peace"" approach to nuclear disarmament, whereas Daniel Philpott describes the growth of a ""peacebuilding"" approach—two similar approaches that are yet distinct in their engagement with military actors. Bernard Prusak then ends this section with a paper on the need to follow up any prophetic indictment of nuclear weapons with genuine deliberative discussion. In Part Five, the focus turns to various aspects of ""Conscience Formation."" The challenge of breaking through the dominant cultural milieu supporting nuclear weapons is highlighted by Margaret Pfeil. Joseph Fahey then describes the rich resources in the Catholic moral tradition for mounting a conscientious refusal of nuclear weapons. The need to reshape the cultural imagination so that Church and civil groups can build a world without nuclear weapons is discussed by Lisa Cahill. And Drew Christiansen calls for much more pastoral accompaniment from the Church to those who challenge the nuclear arms complex. Part Six, ""Moral Education,"" opens with an essay by Kelsey Davenport calling for a revival of disarmament education. This is followed by David Holloway's review of the history of nuclear weapons. Theodore Dedon then suggests ways to advocate for peace using digital means. And John Paul Lederach imagines a world without nuclear weapons, one step at a time. The focus of the seventh part is on ""Responsible Actors"" and their ethical obligations. Included here is Maryann Cusimano Love's discussion of workers at nuclear command centers and other military personnel. Drew Christiansen highlights the responsibilities of policymakers, whereas Susi Snyder examines those making money in the production of nuclear weapons. In his essay, Pierce Corden looks at scientists and technologists in nuclear industries, and David Lammy at political representatives in government. Ramón Luzárraga importantly focuses on those who actually build nuclear weapons. Finally, James O'Sullivan points out the moral obligation of citizens and members of civil society. The entire volume concludes with Part Eight, which contains one essay by Kevin Ahern on ""The Role of Lay Catholic Movements,"" particularly the mediating role they can perform between the higher echelons of the Vatican and average Catholics in the pews. As seen just in the scope and breadth of the topics in both of these volumes, as well as the diversity of voices included, these essays will bring any reader up to speed with Catholic thinking on nuclear weapons. The collection also contributes a great deal to Catholic thinking itself on this topic. In fact, the editors report that on the day after the pope's address in 2017, Archbishop Silvano Tomasi asked Drew Christiansen ""to gather moral and pastoral theologians to elaborate on the pope's teaching"" and so help disseminate this teaching and field the questions that are sure to arise. What is missing from both these volumes, however, is an honest and forthright recognition of the role of nuclear weapons in the modern nuclear state, particularly the United States where so many of the contributors live. Garry Wills has employed the term ""Bomb Power"" (in his 2010 book of that title), to describe the secrecy surrounding the US nuclear weapons program and the all-encompassing—almost existential—nature of the national security state that has developed around nuclear weapons. This is certainly true of the modern US presidency where the ever-increasing centralization of power around the ""Commander in Chief"" is intrinsically tied to the fact that the president has the authority unilaterally to order the launch of nuclear weapons anytime and for any reason. Wills shows that the notion of an authoritarian president is fundamentally linked to nuclear weapons. But this admission is not to be found in these pages. Nor is there much said in these volumes on the way nuclear weapons have also reshaped the way Americans see their country and themselves. As Robert Jay Lifton and Greg Mitchell have pointed out (in Hiroshima in America [1995]), the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki required, and continue to require, Americans to go to great lengths to justify the bombings in order to see their country and themselves as the good guys. The postwar invention of the myth that the bombings somehow saved millions of lives (initial justifications for the bombings made no such claims) is but one example of how nuclear weapons have indelibly marked US society and culture. All this is to say that the place of nuclear weapons within the United States—if not all modern nation states—goes far beyond foreign policy. So, what is to be done? As the above summary makes clear, many of the contributors to these volumes focus on the realist or pragmatic policy side of the nuclear deterrence debate—though not all. Indeed, a significant number focus on the more personal or pastoral means to confront nuclear weapons and the milieu that has grown them. And Pope Francis's denunciation of nuclear weapons clearly encourages such means. Perhaps the most powerful of these are the essays on and by the ""hibakusha,"" or survivors of the horrors of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. These first-hand accounts of the horrors of nuclear weapons are important reminders to the many of us to whom nuclear weapons have become abstract and their destruction only imagined. Hearing such testimony is especially important for persons whose relationship to the production and maintenance (and possible use) of nuclear weapons is immediate. The essays addressing those who work not only in nuclear command centers but also in the industries producing (and profiting from) nuclear weapons—the scientists, engineers, corporate executives, and manufacturers—stand out. Likewise, the essays on moral discernment and conscience formation offer means for individuals to work through the question of what can be done to resist nuclear weapons and their place in society. And Sargent's essay on the Plowshares Movement points to a concrete example of such resistance. What these volumes could have used are more essays imagining what the United States and the world would look like without nuclear weapons hanging over them—such imagination is greatly lacking today. The editors state that their audience comprises three groups in particular: (1) colleges and universities, especially Catholic ones, as well as those that teach diplomats, military personnel, and policymakers; (2) pastoral workers who are on the ""front lines"" of transmitting and interpreting Church teaching to the faithful; and (3) men and women in the military and in the national security sector. These audiences would certainly benefit from both these volumes, as would anyone interested in the present state of the debate—both within Catholic moral theology and beyond—over nuclear deterrence. We can only hope that these two volumes will provide a necessary restart to this debate—a debate that has of late been eclipsed by discussions of climate change, which is why the essays linking nuclear weapons with environmental concerns are helpful. For, as the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists reminds us, the world has never been closer to nuclear war than it is today. The author declares no conflicts of interest.","Nuclear Issues and Defense; Bacillus and Francisella bacterial research; Yersinia bacterium, plague, ectoparasites research"

Situated as an account of punishment, expressivism has been criticised for being too abstract and lacking an immanent meaning or for its dialectic position in relation to punishment. Addressing this theoretical shortcoming, this article remediates our understanding of expressivism, establishing new knowledge of the meaning of norm expressivism in IR and clarifying the relationship between expressivism and notions of punishment in criminal justice and norm research. To this end, it hermeneutically deconstructs the rhetoric of country delegates at the United Nations in the aftermath of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. It examines crucial examples of expressivism: disagreement pronouncements, denunciation of norm violation, postulation of guilt, and penal analogies. While criminal justice research posits expressivism as a distinct account of punishment, the novelty of this article consists in illustrating how, even in the absence of prosecution in the courtroom, expressivist rationales can have a reinforcing effect on the international legal order.",International Law and Human Rights; Global Peace and Security Dynamics; Global Security and Public Health

It does so by situating the debate about the rights and wrongs of supplying arms to Ukraine within the frame of jus ad vim (the just use of force-short-of-war). Concentrating on the German debate, which has been particularly polarized, the article demonstrates how the moral vocabulary of jus ad vim can illuminate the difficult moral choices associated with providing lethal aid to Ukraine. In particular, the article shows how the objective of not getting drawn into war with Russia foregrounds the ‘probability of escalation’ principle of jus ad vim. In addition, the German chancellor's avoidance of the term ‘victory’ as the desired outcome of his nation's support for Ukraine points to the concept of a ‘moral truncated victory’ and the re-establishment and containment principles of jus ad vim. However, while the moral vocabulary of jus ad vim leads to a deeper understanding of the ethical challenges NATO leaders are facing in their provision of weapons to Ukraine, the article concludes that the acceptance of moral truncated victory highlights one of the main critiques of this new framework, namely that it risks creating a morally problematic regime of perpetual force, or vis perpetua.","War, Ethics, and Justification; Global Peace and Security Dynamics; European and Russian Geopolitical Military Strategies"

One of the reasons for this is an implicit association between tragic themes and a lack of constructive benefit. Therefore, this paper uses concepts from art and cinema to offer a new perspective on public ""fears"": ecstatic reframing. By treating negative narratives not as roadblocks to progress, but portals into latent dreams, this novel method reframes such views as housing a positive vision. However, while this offers a new approach regarding public talk of emerging science and technology, lay ethics is ultimately insufficient to deal with the underlying problems that stimulate their tragic tone. This paper uses a classic concept from anthropology--rites of passage--to argue that public unease is fundamentally cultural: modernity's lack of a collectively agreed upon worldview and primordial ritual structure for stewarding change.

We have enjoyed sixty years without nuclear weapons exploded in anger.” To this, he added a question: “Can we make it through another half dozen decades?” Contemporary technological innovation, weapons proliferation, increased modernization efforts, and nuclear saber-rattling have made Schelling's question an urgent one. Recently, there has been an explosion in scholarship attempting to test the resilience of nonuse. These scholars have focused primarily on methodological innovations, generating an impressive body of evidence about the future of nonuse. Yet we argue that this literature is theoretically problematic: it reduces mechanisms of nuclear nonuse to a “rationalist” versus “normative” dichotomy which obscures the distinct pathways to nuclear (non)use within each theoretical framework. With rationalist theories, the current literature commits the sin of conflation, treating what should be distinct mechanisms—cost and credibility—as a single causal story. With normative theories, scholars have committed a sin of omission, treating norms as structural and overlooking mechanisms of norm contestation. We show that teasing out these different causal pathways reveals radically different expectations about the future of nonuse, especially in a world of precision nuclear weapons.","Nuclear Issues and Defense; Nuclear and radioactivity studies; Graphite, nuclear technology, radiation studies"

Reducing tensions will require compromises by both China and the United States. It would be difficult to achieve real trust between the U.S. and Chinese governments—but the record of U.S.–Soviet and U.S.–Russian nuclear arms control suggests that nuclear arms restraints are possible even between countries that see each other as adversaries. If China continues its current nuclear buildup with no restraints and no indication of where it is headed, it will force the United States to assume the worst and respond accordingly, potentially provoking a major nuclear arms race. Such competition would undermine China’s national security and likely destroy prospects for negotiated arms control. While China understandably rejects the idea of treaties that would permanently lock it into nuclear inferiority, some forms of nuclear restraint would serve China’s national interests by limiting the dangers of such an arms competition and potentially limiting U.S. forces and actions that China considers threatening. The Chinese government should instruct its nuclear experts and American politics experts to work together to develop proposals that would serve China’s interest and have a realistic chance of being negotiated.",Nuclear Issues and Defense

By integrating a framework developed by linguist Ray Jackendoff to describe the experience of language with the study of danger in International Relations, and by employing an interpretive textual analysis technique to danger descriptions made by world leaders embedded in different historical and cultural settings constructing different security dangers, I develop and illustrate the ‘danger framework’. In describing the unique features with which leaders experience security dangers, the danger framework theorises the qualia of danger experience and how it is organised into the conscious field of leaders.

Using instruments and expertise supplied by Spain, Cuban scientists have characterized local aerosol optical and microphysical properties, and their chemical composition and optical absorbing properties. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Ångström exponent observations were used to validate MODIS satellite observations and broadband AOD from local pyrheliometers. Sun photometer cloud optical depth allowed us to characterize local cloudiness and its radiative forcing. Scientific work included climatologies of the solar radiation for the last four decades at Camagüey and of aerosols in the Caribbean basin in the last two decades. Another result was designing, building and processing of a low-cost all-sky camera. Besides scientific results, the cooperation allowed the Cuban sun photometer observations to contribute to the Red Ibérica de Medida Fotométrica de Aerosoles and AERONET. A workshop celebrating ten years of cooperation was held at Camagüey in 2016. The workshop participants evaluated the progress, difficulties and challenges and inaugurated a Spanish angular calibration bench for solar radiation sensors at Camagüey.

The main objective of this research is to question the truth-value of violent ISIS videos and to advocate a critical approach to them. To this end, four key issues need to be explored: the quality of the videos; their status as art, documentary, or propaganda; their target audiences; and the purpose of the message being conveyed to each of those audiences. To deconstruct the mechanisms employed by the constructed fallacy of this video and critically expose its literal and metaphorical meaning, we use textual analysis, the methodological tool developed in Greimasian semiotics. The results reveal a carefully planned text with a clearly recognizable narrative structure (crime and punishment). This video is a propaganda documentary that makes use of the tools of fiction to stage a real event: Foley dies, but his death is not shown on camera; it is only staged. Targeting two different audiences, an implicit Muslim viewer, and an explicit Western viewer, the text can be interpreted as a crossing of gazes between East and West.","Terrorism, Counterterrorism, and Political Violence; Crime, Deviance, and Social Control"

The figure does not easily fit the common definition of a monster and yet, the Wandering Jew is extraordinary. In the medieval and early modern sources of the legend, the Wandering Jew, who once sinned against Christ and is therefore doomed to be an immortal eyewitness to the Passion, serves as a model for the faithful. In his 1796 gothic novel, The Monk, Matthew Lewis creates a new strand of the Wandering Jew tradition, a gothic Wandering Jew, a being transformed from wonder to horror through association with centuries of antisemitic accusations against Jews as agents of conspiracy, ritual murder, nefarious magic, and disease. This essay argues that a variation on the representation of the gothic Wandering Jew, which began with Coleridge’s Rime of the Ancient Mariner, further adapts the legend to make the Wanderer not a sign of redemption, but the monstrous cause of catastrophe not only for himself, but for those he encounters. This article, the first scholarly examination of John Blackburn’s 1972 Wandering Jew novel, Devil Daddy, situates it within the strand of the legend that represents the Wandering Jew as a monstrous source of destruction. Blackburn’s novel, written during a time of global concern over the development of biological weapons of mass destruction, portrays the Wandering Jew’s curse as a source of manmade global environmental catastrophe. In this way, the sin of the monstrous Wandering Jew becomes one not against Christ, but against humankind. Even as Devil Daddy explicitly references the horrors of the Holocaust, this representation of a monstrous Wandering Jew haunts the text, undermining its sympathetic representation of Jewish suffering.",Jewish and Middle Eastern Studies; Religious Studies and Spiritual Practices; Themes in Literature Analysis

Using perspectives informed by hauntology and monster theory, I contend that educators can benefit from these conceptual frameworks. Hauntology is a philosophical concept introduced by Jacques Derrida, focusing on the idea of the persistence of the past within the present and the impact of forgotten or repressed histories on contemporary culture. It explores how the «spectres» of past events and ideologies continue to influence and haunt current social and cultural contexts. Monster theory, on the other hand, is a framework developed by Jeffrey Jerome Cohen that examines how monsters in literature and folklore serve as symbols for societal anxieties and cultural conflicts. It interprets monsters as embodiments of societal fears, otherness, and transgressions, bringing to light key elements of cultural norms and human psychology. Both present viewpoints on looking into how the past and cultural anxieties shape our present realities. The discussion in this paper includes pedagogical tools that address transgender experiences, such as the seven facets of Socratic seminars designed to foster conversations on cosmopolitan ideals of diversity. Additionally, the value of guiding students to consistently question «who, where, and why» is emphasised, with a focus on how a monstrous lens can contribute to the enhancement of developmental learning experiences. This article addresses both educators and enthusiasts of gender perspectives, advocating for teaching environments that enable students to explore a world beyond societal expectations. It also appeals to those interested in hauntology and monstrous lens theory, encouraging the integration of these theories to advance educational development.","Shakespeare, Adaptation, and Literary Criticism; Media Influence and Health; Rhetoric and Communication Studies"

This question stems from the fact that, while the vast majority of transhumanists explicitly reject established religion, elements of transhumanism seem strikingly similar to Christian eschatology. This article explores this question by asking how the ontology of an avowedly religious transhumanist movement, the Mormon Transhumanist Association, differs from the informatic ontology identified in secular transhumanism. It shows how contemporary Mormon Transhumanist imaginings of various forms of technological resurrection are informed by the infrastructure and materialist ontology associated with the Mormon practice of “Proxy baptisms” (otherwise known as baptisms for the dead) and other initiatory rituals conducted by proxy on behalf of the deceased. This influence suggests that, at least in this case, there are identifiable differences between secular transhumanism and religious transhumanism that complicate any easy reading of secular transhumanism as being crypto-religion.","Mormonism, Religion, and History; Religious Studies and Spiritual Practices; Folklore, Mythology, and Literature Studies"

The main research question was whether a novel can be useful in promoting soft skills among engineering students. Qualitative and quantitative data, in the form of interviews and a questionnaire, were collected from the students about the value of this novel in enhancing their soft skills. It was found that, as a result of this intervention, they became more aware of these skills and the application of said skills in their daily lives. This study argues for the inclusion of humanities education for engineering students to develop their soft skills and to inspire human values in them.",Engineering Education and Curriculum Development; Higher Education and Employability; Biomedical and Engineering Education

D. Wilson; Elena Macevičiūtė,University of Borås,False,closed,https://doi.org/10.1108/jd-06-2024-0156,"Purpose The aim of the research reported here was to determine how Lithuanian citizens engaged in information-seeking behaviour in response to the stress caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Design/methodology/approach An interview survey was designed, using a semi-structured interview schedule. A convenience sample of 21 participants was obtained and the interviews lasted between 20 and 70 min. The schedule design was guided by the transactional theory of stress and coping and employed the Perceived Stress Scale. Findings A majority of participants experienced moderate to high levels of stress associated with the war in Ukraine. Information seeking and discussing information found with family members and friends played a significant role in helping to moderate stress. Most of the participants understood more than one language and, consequently, were able to compare local information sources with international sources. Only five participants were active users of social media, the rest were critical of these sources. All participants valued those sources they believed to be reliable and truthful. Research limitations/implications The small convenience sample of educated urban participants limits generalizability but provides indicative findings for future investigations into information behaviour during prolonged international conflicts. Practical implications The study highlights the importance of media literacy in managing psychological stress during geopolitical tensions, demonstrating how strategic information seeking and social support can serve as effective coping mechanisms. Social implications The research reveals psychological impacts of war beyond direct conflict zones, illustrating how communities develop collective emotional resilience through informed, critically engaged information practices. Originality/value The study provides unique insights by examining war-related stress in a neighbouring country not directly experiencing conflict, applying stress-coping theory to understand intricate information-seeking behaviours during a geopolitical crisis.","Migration, Health and Trauma; Misinformation and Its Impacts; Identity, Memory, and Therapy"

The SLA has proved to be a popular approach, not least because it is holistic and ‘people-centered’, and forces a requirement that livelihoods, along with their vulnerability and institutional contexts, are well understood before interventions are designed and implemented to help the community. However, its theoretical underpinning has been questioned, and some have pointed to the weak representation of important dimensions such as power, including its link to globalization, and culture, with the latter including faith. This paper explores the various ways that these issues have been addressed by using faith as a lens, and makes a case for a ‘Sustainable Living Approach’ (SLivA) to provide a stronger dovetailing with the capabilities/functionings approach of Amartya Sen. However, there is a trade-off between the complexity of frameworks and their practicability, and more work is needed in this area, especially in terms of the potential contribution of technologies such as very-high-resolution Earth Observation, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.","Religion, Society, and Development; Income, Poverty, and Inequality; Climate change impacts on agriculture"

By adopting an innovative framework for analysis, the book challenges the constrained focus of much of the existing literature by explaining that the pathways to nuclear security for different actors across the globe will vary considerably in this new context. It argues that the Third Nuclear Age will be defined by friction and conflict between ""Nuclear Traditionalists,"" ""Technological Transformers,"" ""Hedgers and Balancers,"" and ""Activists and Protestors,"" as different interests and visions of the nuclear future clash. The book draws on dozens of interviews and non-English language sources to provide a global approach and looks at the security politics driving the political debate in 20 different countries across the globe. This book will be of much interest to students of nuclear politics, security studies and International Relations.

The special procedure for the creation of unitary enterprises realizing certain state interests, the extension of subordination of state authorities to their activities with a priority of the federal level, the possibility of additional capitalization of the enterprise by the owner, the special status of the property assigned to it, and other circumstances allowed us to conclude that it is impossible for a unitary enterprise to ensure its economic security.

These budding journalists hail from Greece, were studying in higher education or adult education at the time of the survey, and belong to one of the three youngest generational cohorts within adults (i.e., 18 years old and older); Generation X where their members are now known as Xers, Generation Y where their members are already known as Millennials, and Generation Z where their members are also known as Zoomers—XYZ Generations. The survey’s research data were collected after six interactive teachings from and through advanced technologies, via a specially designed written questionnaire, as case study experiments that applied qualitative action research with quasi-experiments. Analysis, descriptive, and inductive statistics were then applied to them from and through Internet applications and services. This is essentially empirical qualitative research that incorporates the approach of the quantitative analysis process. The resulting survey findings and results mainly contribute to the quality of higher education and adult education, especially in the field of media studies. Likewise, they align with or confirm previous contemporary empirical studies and research papers on the genealogical characteristics, habits, and ethos of the XYZ Generations, and particularly regarding the similarities among Xers and Zoomers, as well as that Generation Z can also be characterized as a “Sound Generation”. An important conclusion of this research article is that the success of a lesson or even a lecture seems to depend (a) on the good design and/or development of the lesson plan itself, as well as (b) on the communication classroom where the educational praxis takes place. Finally, these survey findings and results are also considered encouraging and could be utilized (a) for any audiovisual-supported teaching–learning procedure for adult learners; (b) across various educational levels and disciplines; or even (c) for members other generational cohorts.","Generational Differences and Trends; Child Development and Digital Technology; Education, Sociology, Communication Studies"

This article first presents the beginnings of a framework for the analysis of behavioral aspects of population mobility in the aftermath of a CBRN event in terms of four phases: quarantine, evacuation, resettlement, and return. Population movements are often omitted from economic consequence analyses because of the difficulty of conceptualizing and estimating them. Through a synthesis of the literature in the context of our analytical framework, we provide estimates of the drivers of important dimensions of population mobility relating to compliance, geography, and timing for each major threat type. We also provide an assessment of error bounds on these estimates. Our findings indicate that omission of various dimensions of population mobility can lead to the underestimation of economic consequences of CBRN events by one or two orders of magnitude. The analysis is intended to point out the relative sensitivities of bottom-line economic impacts to the various population mobility dimensions, so as to guide researchers undertaking this estimation and to help prioritize future research on reducing uncertainties in the direction of drivers that are the most impactful.",Risk Perception and Management; Disaster Management and Resilience; Health disparities and outcomes

Sabin; Elisa Palazzi,National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Reading,True,diamond,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-6-43-2025,"Abstract. Western disturbances (WDs) are synoptic-scale weather systems embedded within the subtropical westerly jet. Manifesting as upper-level troughs often associated with a lower-tropospheric low over western or northern India, they share some dynamical features with extratropical cyclones. WDs are most common during the boreal winter (December to March), during which they bring the majority of precipitation – both rain and snow – to the western Himalaya, as well as to surrounding areas of north India, Pakistan, and the Tibetan Plateau. WDs are also associated with weather hazards such as heavy snowfall, hailstorms, fog, cloudbursts, avalanches, frost, and cold waves. In this paper, we review recent developments in understanding WDs and their impacts. Over the last decade, recent studies have collectively made use of novel data, novel analysis techniques such as tracking algorithms, and the increasing availability of high-resolution weather and climate models. This review is separated into six main sections – structure and thermodynamics, precipitation and impacts, teleconnections, modelling experiments, forecasting at a range of scales, and paleoclimate and climate change – each motivated with a brief discussion of the accomplishments and limitations of previous research. A number of step changes in understanding are synthesised. Use of new modelling frameworks and tracking algorithms has significantly improved knowledge of WD structure and variability, and a more frequentist approach can now be taken. Improved observation systems have helped quantification of water security over the western Himalaya. Convection-permitting models have improved our understanding of how WDs interact with the Himalaya to trigger natural hazards. Improvements in paleoclimate and future climate modelling experiments have helped to explain how WDs and their impacts over the Himalaya respond to large-scale natural and anthropogenic forcings. We end by summarising unresolved questions and outlining key future WD research topics.",Climate variability and models; Cryospheric studies and observations; Meteorological Phenomena and Simulations
