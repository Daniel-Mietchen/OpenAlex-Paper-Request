Previous studies have suggested urban agriculture as a resilience measure in the context of climate change and other natural hazards. Aims To estimate the contribution a radical pivot to urban agriculture could have in building resilience to GCRs and the near-urban industrial agriculture needed to supplement urban food production. Methods We determined optimum crops by food calorie and protein per area for urban and near-urban agriculture. We calculated the land area available for food production within a temperate globally median-sized city using Google Earth image analysis of residential lots and open city spaces. We calculated the population that could be fed through urban agriculture alone, and the extra near-urban land required for cropping with industrial agriculture to feed the remaining city population, under both normal climate, and potential nuclear winter conditions. Results Peas (normal climate), and sugar beet/spinach (nuclear winter) were the optimal crops for urban agriculture, with potatoes (normal climate), and wheat/carrots (nuclear winter) optimal for industrial near-urban production. Urban agriculture could feed 20.4% of the population. At least 1140 hectares of near-urban cultivation could make up the shortfall. Another 110 hectares of biofuel feedstock like canola (rapeseed) could provide biodiesel to run agricultural machinery without fuel trade. Significantly more cultivated area is needed in nuclear winter scenarios due to reduced yields. Conclusion Relatively little optimized near-urban industrial agriculture, along with intensified urban agriculture could feed a median-sized city in a GCR, while minimizing fuel requirements. Governments and municipal authorities could consider land use policy that encourages development of urban agriculture and near-urban cultivation of optimal crops, along with processing and local biofuel refining capacity.","Urban Agriculture and Sustainability; Environmental, Ecological, and Cultural Studies"

More specifically, it navigates nuclear weapons politics through visual narratives, online participatory culture and fragmented senses of humour, underscoring the significance of popular culture as a reflector and producer of the social world. As everyday knowledge about nuclear weapons becomes increasingly fragmented and intertextual, scholars must turn their attention to the politics of the anecdotal and accidental. Nuclear weapons have a narrative power that exists external to the weapons themselves. These narratives are shown to construct and reconstruct popular imaginings about nuclear weapons and war; their beginnings, middles and ends. Recentring nuclear weapons and war around the Barbie film makes visible those gendered and militarised discourses that may otherwise be backgrounded or normalised. We should encounter those broader questions of feminism and militarisation with attention to the fragmented aspects of world politics; the parts of politics that live and breathe, move and bend, confront and challenge us. The Barbiefication of the images of nuclear war make visible the characters, settings and plot of nuclear weapons as they exist in the popular imagination. The making and sharing of memes demonstrates those aspects of the nuclear story that seem fixed, as well as those that can be edited, distorted and played with. Discourses of gender and militarism exist not only within the ‘high’ politics of technostrategic defence planning or policymaking but also as fragments of humour, sentiment and affect scattered across the internet and approached as play – not politics.","Gender, Feminism, and Media; Youth Education and Societal Dynamics; Utopian, Dystopian, and Speculative Fiction"

In this way, unpredictable and unpreventable conditions have forced businesses and decision-makers to develop strategies and act with multiple alternatives to take precautions. With the COVID-19 outbreak, the high dependence of countries, industries and businesses on their suppliers and the extent to which interruptions cause disruptions have shown themselves with brutal consequences. In this study, by focusing on the literature and real case studies, the disruptions experienced by supply chains during the COVID-19 period are discussed, and the measures taken to improve supply-chain resilience against disruptions after the pandemic are evaluated. Thus, by analysing the case studies obtained through six semi-structured interviews with supply-chain businesses from various industries, the lessons learned from the COVID-19 experiences have revealed the practices that can respond quickly to change, make more functional decisions at times of risk, and take more robust steps in the event of a different disruption in the future, on the purpose of developing supply chain resilience.",Supply Chain Resilience and Risk Management

Over the past two decades, the field of GCR/ER research has grown considerably. However, there has been little meta-research on the field itself. How large has this body of literature become? What topics does it cover? Which fields does it interact with? What challenges does it face? To answer these questions, here we present the first systematic bibliometric analysis of the GCR/ER literature. We consider all 3,437 documents in the OpenAlex database that mention either GCR or ER, and use bibliographic coupling (two documents are considered similar when they share many references) to identify ten distinct emergent research clusters in the GCR/ER literature. These clusters align in part with commonly identified drivers of GCR, such as advanced artificial intelligence (AI), climate change, and pandemics, or discuss the conceptual foundations of the GCR/ER field. However, the field is much broader than these topics, touching on disciplines as diverse as economics, climate modeling, agriculture, psychology, and philosophy. The metadata reveal that there are around 150 documents published on GCR/ER each year, the field has highly unequal gender representation, most research is done in the US and the UK, and many of the published articles come from a small subset of authors. We recommend creating new conferences and potentially new journals where GCR/ER focused research can aggregate, making gender and geographic diversity a higher priority, and fostering synergies across clusters to think about GCR/ER in a more holistic way. We also recommend building more connections to new fields and neighboring disciplines, such as systemic risk and policy, to encourage cross-fertilisation and the broader adoption of GCR/ER research.",Supply Chain Resilience and Risk Management; Disaster Management and Resilience

There would also be considerable changes to the global climate system, threatening human health and sustainability. Our work reveals a reduction of global‐scale tropical cyclones (TCs) from a simulation of a nuclear war scenario that could produce ∼150 million tons of smoke. In response to nuclear war, there would be spatially uneven cooling that would result in an anomalous sea surface temperature (SST) gradient pattern. Associated with this would be an anomalous zonal vertical circulation, tending to suppress upward motion and increase vertical wind shear over all TC main development regions, largely explaining the observed TC reduction at regional and global scales.

While their output is expected to be little affected by global warming, wind, and solar electricity generation could be affected by more drastic climatic changes, such as abrupt sunlight reduction scenarios (ASRSs) caused by nuclear war (“nuclear winter”) or supervolcanic eruptions (“volcanic winter”). This paper assesses the impacts of an ASRS on global energy supply and security in a 100% renewable energy scenario. National generation mixes are determined according to roadmaps for a global transition to renewable energy, with wind and solar contributing a combined 94% of the global energy supply. Wind and solar generation are determined for a baseline climate and an ASRS following a large-scale nuclear exchange. While effects vary by country, overall wind and solar generation are expected to reduce by 59% in the first year following an ASRS, requiring over a decade for full recovery. Ensuring sufficient energy for everyone’s critical needs, including water, food, and building heating/cooling, would require international trade, resilient food production, and/or resilient energy sources, such as wood, geothermal, nuclear power, tidal power, and hydropower.","Global Energy and Sustainability Research; Oil, Gas, and Environmental Issues; Impact of Light on Environment and Health"

Given the rapid changes and unknown risks that mark such events, risk communication faces the challenge to raise awareness and concern among the public without creating panic. Drawing on the social amplification of risk framework—a concept that theorizes how and why risks are amplified or attenuated during the (1) transfer of risk information (by, for instance, news media) and (2) audiences’ interpretation and perception of these information—we were interested in the portrayal of risk information and its impact on audiences’ risk perception over the first wave of the Covid‐19 pandemic in Germany. We therefore conducted a quantitative content analysis of a major public and private television (TV) newscast ( N = 321) and combined it with survey data (two‐wave panel survey, t1: N = 1378 and t2: N = 1061). Our results indicate that TV news (as a major information source at that time) were characterized by both risk‐attenuating and risk‐amplifying characteristics, although risk‐amplifying attributes were particularly pronounced by the private TV newscast. Notably, those who only used private TV news between both waves showed the highest perceived severity at time 2. However, the interaction effect of time and use of public and/or private TV news was only significant for perceived susceptibility. Overall, more research is needed to examine the effects of different types of media and changes in risk perceptions over time.",Risk Perception and Management; Public Relations and Crisis Communication; Climate Change Communication and Perception

During the Cold War, events such as the Cuban Missile Crisis saw the world teetering on the brink of a nuclear exchange between great powers. As the proliferation of nuclear weapons came to countries outside the so-called Permanent Five (P5) members of the UN Security Council, fears arose that new nuclear powers such as Israel, Pakistan, and India might use their weapons in a heated exchange. This chapter brings a more comprehensive approach to the nuclear security situation between India and Pakistan by combining traditional and non-traditional dimensions and an environmental security dimension as well. In recent years, India and Pakistan have experienced increasing domestic political instability as well as severe climate change-related events, both of which threaten the populations of these countries beyond the possibility of nuclear war. Thus, we make the argument that these shared human security-related threats that India and Pakistan face could prove to be essential areas for bringing peace and increased bilateral cooperation. We begin by addressing the current status and future of nuclear security within and between India and Pakistan. In particular, how has this bilateral nuclear standoff been impacted by recent political and environmental developments? This chapter examines these growing extremes within India and Pakistan and their likelihood in contributing to nuclear arms control or risk reduction measures. Can the opportunity to collaborate on climate-change related advancements and technology, such as early warning systems for natural disasters or green energy developments, play a role in alleviating the nuclear balance on the Indian subcontinent? In looking towards the future, this chapter explores areas of technological cooperation that might provide a space for nuclear diplomacy and thus, avoid the risk of nuclear catastrophe.","Transboundary Water Resource Management; Politics and Conflicts in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Middle East; Global Peace and Security Dynamics"

In “Koyaanisqazzi”, Reggio depicts an initial state of planetary harmony subsequently disrupted by technological advancement, resulting in an anthropogenically scarred and degraded Earth. Humanity, in this narrative, has lost its intrinsic values and equilibrium. The central conflict of the film lies in the disequilibrium between nature and modern society – life irrevocably thrown out of balance. By presenting viewers with an unrelenting stream of faces within the urban masses and visually depicting planetary degradation, Reggio prompts a critical re-evaluation of individual lifestyles and their associated values.

Results indicate the following: (1) the rate of risk perception contagion gradually increases with the level of individual risk perception and trust in communicators; (2) the risk perception contagion rate gradually decreases as the level of risk governance participation increases; and (3) comparing different social networks, kinship networks have a greater effect than social media networks on risk perception contagion.",Risk Perception and Management; Climate Change Communication and Perception; Evolutionary Game Theory and Cooperation

An abrupt global cooling of several °C—even if only lasting a few years—would present immediate, drastic stress on biodiversity and food production. This cooling poses a global catastrophic risk to human society beyond the immediate and direct impact of eruptions. Using a simple climate model, this paper discusses the possibility of counteracting large volcanic cooling with the intentional release of greenhouse gases. Longer-lived compounds (e.g., CO2 and CH4) are unsuitable for this purpose, but selected fluorinated gases (F-gases), either individually or in combinations, could be released at gigaton scale to offset large volcanic cooling substantially. We identify candidate F-gases (e.g., C4F6 and CH3F) and derive radiative and chemical properties of ‘ideal’ compounds matching specific cooling events. Geophysical constraints on manufacturing and stockpiling due to mineral availability are considered, alongside technical and economic implications based on present-day market assumptions. The effects and uncertainty due to atmospheric chemistry related to aerosol injection, F-gases release, and solar dimming are discussed in the context of large volcanic perturbation. The caveats and future steps using more complex chemistry–climate models are discussed. Despite the speculative nature of the magnitude and composition of F-gases, our conceptual analysis has implications for testing the possibility of mitigating certain global catastrophic cooling risks (e.g., nuclear winter, asteroid impact, and glacier transition) via intentional intervention.",Nuclear Issues and Defense; Gas Dynamics and Kinetic Theory; Climate Change and Geoengineering

Faced with the apparent negation of reason in bringing about the means of its own destruction through the scientific piercing of nature’s innermost workings, the nuclear existentialists end up reaffirming, however precariously, a teleological conception of history in which the apocalyptic fear of the Bomb figures as the necessary condition for the ultimate realisation of human freedom.

Meanwhile, Australia is one of the few countries in its own region that have yet to sign the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW). This paper argues that—US hostility to the Treaty notwithstanding—Australian membership of the TPNW would be consistent with its generally positive disarmament record and compatible with its alliance commitments.",Nuclear Issues and Defense

But under-analysed so far have been the nuclear dimensions of this trend. This is important because we are on the cusp of a multipolar order where the ‘poles of power’ are nuclear-armed. We outline the ways in which almost 30 years of perceptions of unipolarity, and particularly the focus on ‘rogue’ and non-state (nuclear) terrorism post 9/11 on the part of Western policy practitioners, analysts, and scholars, allowed for the previous focus on the threat of nuclear war to be supplanted by a wider ‘nuclear security’ agenda. We unpack the return of nuclear threats and risk-taking in the Euro-Atlantic, the nuclear deterrence balance in the Western Pacific, and the emergence of a non-aligned nuclear great power in the Global South. While we argue that managing the dangers of the return of nuclear great power politics will require a dual approach drawing lessons from both from the Cold War ‘balance of terror’ and from an earlier era of a multipolar ‘balance of power’, many key dynamics from the WoT years remain.",Nuclear Issues and Defense

I argue that the hit TV show House of the Dragon can be utilized to educate students on the nuances of nuclear theory in a fun and engaging—but also surprisingly rigorous—way. In particular, the fire-breathing weapons of mass destruction in the Game of Thrones prequel show illustrate five key lessons about nuclear conflict dynamics. First, nuclear war is incredibly destructive and causes significant psychological trauma to survivors of nuclear attacks. Second, nuclear weapons can induce caution in leaders and deter major war. Third, while a powerful force, nuclear deterrence can fail due to irrational leaders, principle-agent problems, and accidents. Fourth, nuclear compellence is harder than nuclear deterrence and can backfire. Fifth, nuclear superiority beyond a secure second-strike capability provides little strategic benefit. In sum, House of the Dragon offers a more modern option than classics like Dr. Strangelove to teach about nuclear theory.",Innovative Teaching Methodologies in Social Sciences; Nuclear Issues and Defense; Political Science Research and Education

Additionally, we explore the moderating effects of fake news awareness and social tie variety. Design/methodology/approach Drawing upon the social amplification of risk framework, this study investigates the relationship between news quality and users’ news-sharing behaviors, along with its underlying mechanism. An online questionnaire involving 399 eligible participants was employed for hypotheses testing, and the structural equation model served as the main analytical method. Findings The influence of news quality on users’ news-sharing behavior is sequentially mediated by risk perception and perceived believability. Individuals with a heightened awareness of fake news or a diverse social tie are more inclined to perceive greater risks associated with news-sharing behavior and question news authenticity. Originality/value This study contributes to the existing literature on users’ news-sharing behaviors by examining the influence of risk perception on the relationship between news quality, perceived believability and users’ news-sharing behavior. Additionally, it explores the moderating effects of fake news awareness and social tie variety.

Shortly afterwards it began a new life as a museum artefact, but once absorbed into the museum collection the Vulcan did not stagnate. Conservators cared for it; curators documented it; former crew members stood underneath its wings and told their stories. It became much admired by a community of enthusiasts (and even the backdrop to a wedding). Nevertheless, XM597 is gradually succumbing to inevitable deterioration. Like other museum objects, the Vulcan's values changed during its use, arrival and museum afterlife: XM597 means different things to crew, curator, or museum visitor. This chapter explores the contradictions inherent in this giant artefact, and what this can tell us about the changing and contested meanings of objects associated with the Cold War.

Further, the types of cognitive mechanisms and shortcuts used in the politically polarized information environment are similar to some of those used in risk perception. Consequently, political elites may easily create partisan risk positions, largely through politically focused social amplification of risk. The COVID‐19 pandemic provided a natural experiment for testing predictions about such risk politics. We asked questions about pandemic‐related views, behaviors, and policies at the outset of the pandemic in April 2020 and again in September 2020 via public opinion surveys. Our data and analyses focus primarily on a single state, with some analysis extended to four states. We begin by demonstrating strong linkages between political partisan identification on the one hand and support for co‐partisan elites, use of partisan information sources, and support for co‐partisan policies on the other hand. We then find evidence that pandemic risk positions correspond with partisan information sources and find support for a mechanism involving partisan‐tinted evaluation of elite cues. Partisan risk positions quickly became part of the larger polarized structure of political support and views. Finally, our evidence shows on the balance that partisan risk positions related to the pandemic coalesced and strengthened over time. Overall, while self‐identified Democrats consistently viewed the coronavirus as the primary threat, self‐identified Republicans quickly pivoted toward threats to their freedoms and to the economy.",Misinformation and Its Impacts; Social Media and Politics; Electoral Systems and Political Participation

It is a general belief that deterrence has provided strategic stability against the usage of a nuclear weapon. Little attention has been paid over the years to normative behavior that gradually emerged and refrained states from preemptive nuclear strikes. Leaders of both India and Pakistan repeatedly claimed that these weapons are only for defensive purposes. But with changing geopolitical situation this normative behavior has changed. India adopted Cold Start Doctrine (Though it is a conventional military strategy) but due to a huge disparity in the conventional military weapon, Pakistan developed tactical nuclear weapons and adopted the idea of full-spectrum deterrence. When India did not manage to punish Pakistan with conventional means it started looking for other options. The idea of a preemptive counterforce strike and changing of Indian nuclear doctrine got attention. With these debates about nuclear strikes underway, Intrusion by Indian jets inside Pakistan in February 2019, put both countries on brink of war which could escalate into nuclear. Although war averted that time, recently India had repealed the special constitutional status of Occupied Kashmir, which again aggravated the situation.

One intervention not yet analysed is expanding cropland area by converting other types of land, such as pasture and second-growth forests into land that could be cultivated. We find approximately 515 million hectares would be fit for cropland expansion during a catastrophe. Three land-clearing scenarios were explored: the global-equipment-sharing scenario, in which the area fit for expansion is cleared in 12 months, feeding 39% of the global population by the end of the first year after the catastrophe; the no-equipment-trade scenario, in which 442 million hectares of land are cleared in 7 years, feeding 20% of people by the end of the first year, and the export-pool-equipment-trade scenario, where the supply of extra machinery to a few countries allows for the clearing of 511 million hectares in 7 years, feeding 27% of people by the end of the first year.

There are several factors that triggered it, but the primary being NATO’s agenda to expand to Russia’s border, using Ukraine’s indication to become its member as a pretext. Ukraine is a sovereign country and has the right to move westward, but at the same time, Russia’s security concerns cannot be ignored. Ukraine’s membership in NATO is an invitation for the latter to come too close to Russia. If the United States, Britain or France will not allow anyone to encroach into their spheres of influence, why should Russia sit back and not resist the advances of NATO? America does not share a land border with the Solomon Islands, but threw a tantrum when the latter signed a military deal with China in 2022. NATO is a Cold War relic – the Cold War has ended, why is it moving eastward? What if Ukraine as a sovereign country maintains neutrality and retains its dual relations with the East and West? Rather than reverting to a Cold War mentality, the western actors should prioritize peace and refrain further from making provocative statements that can cause a nuclear war. The special military operation could have been prevented or ended a few months after it started if some action-backed utterances were not made by key western actors. In the wake of Donald Trump’s indication to end the conflict if elected president, this paper seeks to analyse how the provocative statements of key Western leaders triggered Russia’s response, aborted negotiation and recommended that they stop making inflammatory remarks to not truncate the plan of the president-elect.","European and Russian Geopolitical Military Strategies; Security, Politics, and Digital Transformation"

This secular is a deep commitment to a belief that need not be religious always: an inner sincerity to see the truth of imagination, the cataclysmic state of the environment, the relational mesh with the non-human world, the grammar and paradox of pain and survival, the reality of an understanding the worldliness neuro-sensually and our embodied responses to the world around. The secular is a habitus, sensibility, embodiment, reflections and critical understanding. Being secular is not always being religious; being secular is about being existential, socio-cultural, neuro-natural, and ecosophical-ecocritical. This chapter is about the dynamics and poetics of togetherness and takes three points of explications: three conceptual performatives in recognition, sublime, and improbability from Amitav Ghosh's book, The Great Derangement . We are amid continuous transcendence where climate change, Anthropocene, species extinction, environmental apocalypse, and nuclear war call for separate configurations of the secular. The secular can no longer work as a priori with its own innatism. This is not the Habermasian and Kantian non-religious reason; this secular reason holds desire, romantic and aesthetic qualities, the spirituality of everydayness, the fragility of existence and terror of the non-human green, the green anxiety, our state and conditions and desires of existence, our restless contemporary. Also, our fullness in life, bio-egalitarianism, planet-sharing ethics, and inclusive humanism that believes in being with plants and non-human animals feature in this secular figuration. In a post-natural world with a new sense of nature and increasingly reversed roles, man continues to deanthropogenise himself. Derangement is our new order and new poetics of living together.","Environmental Philosophy and Ethics; Religion, Ecology, and Ethics; Climate Change and Geoengineering"

They were suspicious of the passions of the crowd and preferred to be ruled by the learned who were skilled in governance. But what if there were a learned person who had also won over the crowd, would that please them? If so, then Andrew Leigh would be their man. A Harvard PhD and former professor of economics at the Australian National University, Leigh was elected to the Australian House of Representatives in 2010 and is currently an assistant minister in the Labor government. This is his 11th book, churned out during the COVID period. He has since written a 12th, and the baker's dozen is sure to follow. What's the Worst That Could Happen? is a deeply researched book looking at the mathematical likelihood of various calamities coming to pass. It says a great deal in a modest 167 substantive pages. In his opening chapter, Leigh takes note of the many apocalyptic movies that have challenged us in the past few decades; he recalls the doomsday clock hovering at mere minutes to midnight; and he pays tribute to his key intellectual source, Toby Ord's The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity (2020, Hachette Books). But I wonder if there is an unnamed influence lurking. Leigh was entering teenagehood when the Midnight Oil lead singer Peter Garrett turned his talents to politics and cast nuclear disarmament onto the national political stage. Surely, young Andrew was paying attention. Nuclear war is one of the existential risks Leigh examines, and the figures bear out his analysis. Even though the number of warheads has been reduced from 70,000 to 14,000, that figure is surely sufficient to do the job of creating nuclear winter, allowing the ants, cockroaches and rats to fight it out for dominion over the planet. Putting our faith in the rationality of governments seems like a risky proposition given that the totalitarian regime of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is among them. And even if governments act rationally, the chances are far from negligible that a terrorist group will get its hands on a nuke and be a catalyst for full-scale war. H. G. Wells's War of the Worlds was written in the late nineteenth century and concluded with the indomitable aliens being defeated by the Earth's humble germs. In the twenty-first century we have come to accept that it is not only the aliens that can succumb. Thus far, our bugs have been either highly contagious or highly deadly, but not both. There is a Darwinian logic to that. A deadly parasite that spreads exponentially would itself die out in the process. But what about bugs grown in labs? Labs can leak, by misadventure or otherwise. One figure Leigh quotes is that there is a 1 per cent chance per decade that a lab will leak its lethal product. Leigh deals with two further physical risks. One is climate change, the risk of which is so well known that it requires little further elaboration. But perhaps a rumination is in order. Florida is a climate-denying state, consistently voting Republican. It is almost in the realm of the biblical that the various plagues of climate catastrophes are being visited upon its shores. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. A mere 60 words, but it seems impossible for the computer scientists to program it into their AI systems. The fear is that HAL, from Stanley Kubrick's movie 2001: A Space Odyssey, will yet have the last word. Leigh summarises the risks numerically and using normal probability mathematics comes to the figure of a one in six chance of one of these existential risks occurring. We are unwittingly playing Russian roulette. Leigh also puts forward in each case the processes to mitigate the risks. These have previously been stated, and many of the avoidance and mitigation strategies are policy positions that have already been adopted or proposed. It is nevertheless comforting to have the risks balanced with actions available to humanity to counter them. Thus far, we have heard from Leigh the academic, but the balance of the book is a cris du coeur from Leigh the politician. He deals with the threat of populism and demonstrates an admirable facility for sharp and succinct analysis – the causes of populism are jobs, snobs, race, pace and luck. I will let the book's readers unpack these words, each supported by statistics and examples. The populist threat is not unrelated to the physical existential risks because in their blind jingoism, the populists reject international cooperation, which is a necessary condition to avert each of the elaborated risks. And in their prevarication with evidence-based decision making, the populists are likely to choose a disastrous short-term action rather than a felicitous policy for the long term and for the benefit of future generations. A corollary of the populist risk is the threat to democracy, and that is the subject of Leigh's penultimate chapter. It is a subject on which I have also written (Rich, 2017), and it also defaults to the problem of democracy in its leading nation, the USA. With the 2024 presidential election campaign in full swing as this review is written, the issues Leigh raises are magnified with every morning headline. Leigh advocates many of the institutional design solutions that I also put forward flowing from our common familiarity with Australian politics. But I have come to realise that although propitious institutional design may be a necessary requirement, it is far from sufficient. I was encouraged that Leigh also writes about civic education as a requirement for maintaining democracy. Ultimately, a nation needs a culture of democracy if it is to sustain a democratic political system. We need to listen to others, maintain civility in our public discourse, learn to evaluate evidence dispassionately, deliberate on difficult problems and accept the inevitable setbacks that democracy will produce. Learning these skills begins in school. Leigh's final chapter is a mix of philosophical considerations and examples of the criticality of effective leadership. That is where this review began. I believe Leigh passes the Platonic test. Hopefully, he will also continue to benefit from the wisdom of the crowd.",Space Science and Extraterrestrial Life
https://openalex.org/W4403353941,The value of space activity,2024-10-01,https://doi.org/10.1111/ecaf.12676,article,0,Economic Affairs,Rebecca Lowe,,False,closed,,"It seems likely that human beings have found space valuable, at least as a source of intrigue, since long before anyone knew much about what exists beyond the Earth's atmosphere. It's only since the 1960s, however, that people have been up there, doing things. In this article, I'm going to discuss 'space activity' in a broad sense, encompassing not only people and man-made machines doing things in space, but also the resource production and use that enables this. In particular, I'll focus on the value of space activity – again, on a broad conception of 'value'. I'll begin by discussing the financial value of space activity: first, in the direct sense of its monetary value, in the context of calculations about the current and potential future size of the space economy; and second, in the derived sense of the good that can be brought about through the spending of the money raised through this kind of economic activity. Next, I'll turn to ways in which space activity furthers the human good: that is, how it can bring about things that are objectively and irreducibly good for human beings. Here, I'll focus on happiness and knowledge – discussing, for instance, the way in which knowledge about space is both valuable in itself and can also assist in meeting valuable societal goals, such as medical progress and peace. Finally, I'll briefly discuss space activity as a source of non-human value, in the sense of the good it can bring about for non-human animals, other living things, and natural resources. Discussion about the current and potential future monetary value of space activity is focused on calculations about the 'space economy'. What this term refers to is contested, particularly in terms of its scope. However, on a 'widely adopted' definition, provided by the OECD in the first edition of its Handbook on Measuring the Space Economy, the 'space economy' refers to ""the full range of activities and the use of resources that create and provide value and benefits to human beings in the course of exploring, understanding, managing and utilising space"" (OECD, 2012, p. 3). In the recent second edition of the handbook, however, the OECD implies that whilst providing a satisfactory definition of the space economy was ""challenging"" back in 2012, subsequent developments have made this task even harder; in particular, ""the line between space and non-space activities is increasingly difficult to assess"" (OECD, 2022, p. 15). This line-drawing problem is evident across attempts to quantify the monetary value of the space economy. And, as the Institute for Defence Analyses (IDA) emphasises, whilst employing expansive definitions can be useful for some purposes, doing so bears risks here: calculations totalling the size of the space economy ""that include downstream activities [that are] not directly related to activities in space may"", for instance, ""mislead policy makers"" (Crane et al., 2020, p. 2). The World Economic Forum attempts to mitigate this problem by dividing the space economy into its ""backbone"" and its ""reach"" – on which the ""backbone"" encompasses ""space applications"" with revenues that ""accumulate directly to space hardware and service providers"", whereas the ""reach"" encompasses those where ""space is playing a key role in enabling companies across industries to generate revenues"" (WEF, 2024, p. 9). Other useful distinctions applied within assessments of the size of the space economy include the following four. First, economic activity is often divided into sectors, whether these are product-focused (e.g. the difference between satellites and rockets) or goal-focused (e.g. the difference between communication and Earth observation). Second, it is often divided into commercial activity and government activity, in terms of both the production of goods and services and the consumption of, and investment in, these goods and services. Third, the space economy and its component 'space systems' are sometimes divided into segments based on location or function: as taxonomised on the New Space Economy site, these segments typically include: space, launch, user, link, and ground (New Space Economy, 2023). Here, examples of everyday technology sometimes included in the ""ground segment"", such as car satnavs, show particularly clearly the blurred line between what counts as 'space' and 'non-space'. Finally, the IDA purposefully takes a ""more targeted"" approach in which the space economy is divided into four expenditure-focused categories: (a) government spending on activity in space; (b) household and business spending on services ""generated in space""; (c) the sales of space goods and services, such as satellites and launches;1 and (d) the sales of products required to ""utilize space services"", such as satellite TV dishes (Crane et al., 2020, p. iii). This context helps to explain why calculations of the 2016 size of the space economy ranged from $166.8 billion, on the IDA's approach, to $350 billion, according to both Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch/Bank of America (OECD, 2022 p. 20). This context should also be taken into account when considering the WEF's recent calculation that the current size of the space economy, on 2023 figures, lies at over $600 billion (WEF, 2024, p. 4). Complications of scope aside, however, Paravano et al. (2023) categorise the current space economy's main value streams as: exploration, observation, satellite navigation, and satellite communications. Indeed, the satellite industry is widely accepted to be an extremely important player,2 with telecoms deemed a crucial ""near-term focus"" (Morgan Stanley, 2022), and ""low-Earth-orbit applications"", in particular, the most significant business opportunity (Menez, 2022). Currently, there are almost 10,000 satellites orbiting Earth (Elefteriu, 2024, p. 4), and the Satellite Industry Association calculates that the commercial satellite industry is worth almost $300 billion and ""accounts for 71 per cent of the world's space business"" (SIA, 2024). Other standard claims about the current space economy include the following four. First, that almost 80 per cent of the space economy's financial value is found in ""commercial space products and services"" (Bank of America Institute, 2023, p. 2). Second, that a ""dramatic"" reduction in payload costs has broken down market barriers, enabling not only new entrants but also the introduction of ""new ideas and business models"" (Menez, 2022). Third, that whilst the space economy is playing an increasing part in everyday life (again, particularly owing to the widespread adoption of satellite technology), there remains much more value for everyday consumers to realise (Paravano et al., 2023). And fourth, that, particularly in richer countries, various ""critical infrastructures"" beyond communications are increasingly dependent on ""space capabilities"" (Menez, 2022), and that this has important implications for national strategy and defence (Elefteriu, 2024), as well as commercial activity. It is universally assumed that the space economy will continue to grow over the next decade. The WEF, again employing an expansive approach, estimates that its size will reach between $1.4 trillion and $2.3 trillion by 2035 (WEF, 2024, p. 23). It's worth noting, however, that assessors making predictions about the future size of the space economy typically admit to omitting certain likely and plausible costs and risks from their calculations — particularly costs and risks relating to societal impact and change. The OECD (2022, p. 113) goes as far as to claim that ""the potential negative effects of space programmes on the business enterprise sector overall and/or on society as a whole are rarely discussed in evaluations of the space economy"". Nonetheless, and as largely reflected in the WEF's neat summaries (WEF, 2024, pp. 5, 23), assessors broadly agree upon core financial risks to the growth of the space economy (including changes in demand and regulation, the broad costs of accidents and disasters, and international political uncertainty, lack of collaboration, and unrest), and upon its core financial opportunities (including cost reductions, as well as growing rates of innovation and general intrigue). Beyond this is awareness of calculatory complications, such as instances in which risks provide financial opportunities, including the growing demand for private companies to tidy up ""space junk"" (Morgan Stanley, 2022), and the particular difficulties involved in attempting to predict future international political settlements. Further standard predictions about the future of the space economy include the following five. First, that the space economy will increase as a proportion of the global economy (WEF, 2024, p. 4). Second, that it will become even more focused on communications (WEF, 2024, p. 23). Third, that there will be an increase in the range of investors, including growing institutional investment (Menez, 2022). Fourth, that space futures markets will expand (Menez, 2022). And fifth, that the number of countries actively involved in the space economy will continue to grow. There's also much discussion about the ongoing relevance of the state. It's generally assumed that state spending will continue to be ""the cornerstone"" of the space economy (WEF, 2024, p. 4), and that state incentives (including grants, procurement opportunities, prizes, and policy targets) will continue to have a significant impact, as will broader legislative and regulatory developments (see, for instance, the recent enaction of the American CHIPS and Science Act, and the EU's development of a European Space Law). Finally, it's worth noting that previous estimates significantly underestimated the then-future size of the space economy: according to the Bank of America (2023), the space economy's size in 2021 was ""up over 60 per cent from estimates just a decade prior"". It's also worth remembering, however, what's been described as the ""wildly missed revenue projections"" (Rainbow, 2024) of the space-focused special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). Beyond calculations about the current and potential future monetary value of space activity is acknowledgement of the good this economic activity can, and does, bring about. I'll discuss below ways in which, for instance, space technology can be used to alleviate Earthly problems and how space activity can further the pursuit of knowledge. But financially, the good of space activity pertains to the good things that the money it raises are spent upon, whether profits or tax revenue, and whether this spending is optional or state-mandated. In other words, if space activity grows as a part of human life, and space continues to offer up new ownerships and new markets, then individuals, groups, and humanity as a whole will gain increasing opportunities to benefit through space-economy money being well spent, in space and on Earth. That space activity remains extremely new, however – and that developments continue to happen apace – complicates questions about the distribution of many of the valuable opportunities the space economy offers. Does it matter, for instance, that such a small number of people, from a small (albeit fast-growing) number of countries, can directly take part in space activity? Whilst 77 countries now have space agencies (Space Crew, 2024), and satellites are reported to be ""registered in 105 countries or multinational organizations"" (Nanoavionics, 2023), only 23 countries have been represented by individuals visiting the International Space Station (NASA, 2024), and only 16 have launch capabilities (Space Crew, 2024). By 2021, the number of people who had spent time in space was only 570, the vast majority of whom were American (Mathieu & Roser, 2023). And what about any economic activity, per se, that these people undertake, whilst they are in space? That is, what about any work they do, or what about any (space or Earthly) resources they consume or otherwise appropriate? How should these activities be regulated? Questions arise about the assignment of legal property rights, about fair and productive approaches to taxation, and, at a meta-level, about who should govern what. These are classic questions, with empirical as well as normative dimensions, which apply to all kinds of economic activity – but, clearly, there are added complexities here. This is not least because space activity is currently governed by international law, which is ill-equipped to deal with certain developments of the space economy. As noted above, states remain, and are predicted to remain, the biggest space players, but commercial actors are playing an ever-growing role. And whilst individuals and firms do face some legal obligations under international law,3 primarily it binds nations. Financially, a key governance consideration relates to the relevance of the inputs of space-created wealth – the resources that have been used, the labour and capital that have been expended – and how this should affect regulation, taxation, and access to opportunity. As yet, this topic is not sufficiently high on any political agenda. And appropriation, at least of the 'physical domain' of space, remains outlawed by the 1967 Outer Space Treaty (see e.g. Hertzfeld et al., 1979, for discussion of the long-running debate over the treaty's interpretation), although various attempts are under way to reform this through peremptory-norm change. For instance, as I've discussed elsewhere, ""NASA has been criticised by some, particularly in competitor countries, for seemingly using the [Artemis] Accords to push a [jus cogens] norm in favour of American interests (or, at least, the interests of players with strong current access to the moon), particularly regarding the matter of ownership"" (Lowe, 2022a, p. 18).4 Within this context, as I've argued before, there's a short time left for humanity to collectively institute an effective and morally justified system for assigning legal property rights in space, if we want to avoid the standard problems of an informal first-come-first-served system, which could see the most valuable space opportunities permanently monopolised by billionaires and autocrats (Lowe, 2022a; for recent context, see Elon Musk's September 2024 announcements about SpaceX's planned crewed flights to Mars – Wall, 2024). Such a situation would be problematic not only in terms of value considerations such as freedom and fairness and equality; it also seems likely that the ensuing lack of competition would represent serious opportunity cost, and could lead to highly limited outcomes. One alternative approach, I've argued, would be to establish a framework to enable individuals and groups to acquire time-limited conditional legal property rights to plots of spaceland, on a Georgist-inspired market system (Lowe, 2022a, 2022b). On my approach, competitors would keep the full profit they made from the permissible use of their plots5 but competition for the temporary ownership of these plots would consist in paying 'rent',6 the rate of which would vary depending on supply and demand, and would be partially rebated in relation to the meeting of various conditions inspired by the Lockean property provisos of 'enough and as good' (e.g. if the use of spaceland contributed to poverty alleviation) and 'spoilage' (e.g. if the use of spaceland contributed to conservation efforts). This rent would be paid into a fund administered to enable an increasing number of individuals and groups to compete for plots, through investment in space innovation. I'm now going to turn to some ways in which space activity can further basic human goods. There are various approaches to conceiving of such goods, but I'll take a simple conception on which there are multiple things that are generally and irreducibly objectively good for human beings qua human beings – things like knowledge, achievement, and friendship. This isn't to deny the importance of subjectively valuing objectively valuable things. Or to deny that finding satisfaction in such things, in the form of happiness, is objectively good for humans: indeed, I'll discuss it below, largely as such. But it is to assert upfront that a hedonistic conception of the good, on which the good reduces solely to happiness, or pleasure or preference satisfaction, is an overly narrow account. There are also various approaches to determining and cataloguing the range of basic human goods (for a useful overview see Murphy, 2019). For current purposes, I'll focus on happiness and knowledge as examples of such goods, and consider some ways in which space activity can further these particular goods. In this context, I'm happy to assert that whilst assessing moral value in terms of basic human goods is sometimes seen as an approach peculiar to the natural law tradition, nonetheless finding objective value in happiness and knowledge is a deeply intuitive idea, evidence of which can be found (implicitly if not explicitly) within most accounts of morality, even though there are many differences between such accounts over different-order matters. In other words, beyond complex meta-ethical debate, it seems uncontroversial to conceive of happiness and knowledge as 'good for' human beings, and space activity as offering distinct opportunities for furthering these good things. I'll begin by briefly discussing space activity as a source of human happiness. Beyond the happiness that can derive from, for instance, the spending of space money on meeting valuable goals such as medical progress, this can be seen most clearly in the accounts of people who have spent time in space. Indeed, it made headline news when William Shatner returned from space and claimed that the experience made him feel sadness and grief; that he found, looking into the darkness, ""no mystery, no majestic awe to behold"" (Shatner, 2022). More typical accounts involve emotional descriptions of deep feelings of happiness. Whilst on board the International Space Station, for instance, the Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti tweeted an ancient Chinese text, which she translated as, ""Looking up, I see the immensity of the cosmos; bowing my head, I look at the multitude of the world. The gaze flies, the heart expands, the joy of the senses can reach its peak, and indeed, this is true happiness"" (Wei & Siqi, 2022). Expressions of such happiness are familiar, as are those of great wonder and satisfaction. I'm not suggesting here that wonder and satisfaction are the same as happiness, but rather that, as nearby concepts, they often coincide with and contribute to it. And that even the indirect 'experience' of spending time in space – as an engaged spectator on Earth – is widely acknowledged to bring about these kinds of feelings. Space activity is regularly described as an 'achievement of humankind'; a core reason for expensive state spending on space programmes is to engender national pride and unity. On the other hand, spending time in space poses extreme risks to human well-being. For some, such as the fighter-pilot astronauts with the crazy kind of bravery that Tom Wolfe (1979) describes as 'the right stuff', this danger adds an exhilarating edge to the happiness of experiencing space. For others, including the families of those astronauts, it can provoke unhappiness, fear, and even trauma. Indeed, whilst space programmes clearly bring happiness into the lives of many on Earth who vicariously share in the experience of space activity, there are significant contrary cases. Watching the Challenger disaster live on television would have been the first time that many children witnessed human death: one psychological study into traumatic effects reports that ""[s]hortly after the explosion, shuttle-related dreams were prevalent, especially on the East Coast, where they occurred at a rate of 62% [of the children interviewed for the study]"" (Terr et al., 1999, p. 1539). In this context – and the context of astronauts who, like Shatner, do not find happiness spending time in space – it is perhaps more straightforward to think about the value of 'experiencing space' in terms of objective human goods furthered by space activity that don't depend on their experients' feelings: for example, you don't have to feel as if you have made an achievement to have done so. An alternative approach is to look to something much broader than happiness, which is nonetheless dependent on positive subjective experience: the sense of fulfilment that comes from meeting one's valuable goals. I'm now going to turn to the epistemic value of space activity. There's a distinction to be made here between the way in which space activity enables us to know more about space and the way in which space activity enables us to know more about non-space things. I'm going to set the former aside, however, and simply accept that it is good to know things about the whole of the world around us, and that space activity is necessary to a significant part of this. Rather, I'll focus on the way in which knowledge acquired through space activity can help us to further valuable non-space-specific societal goals. As the WEF emphasises, ""[b]eyond revenue generation, space will [over the coming decade] play an increasingly crucial role in mitigating world challenges, ranging from disaster warning and climate monitoring, to improved humanitarian response"" (WEF, 2024, p. 4). That is, progress made in the pursuit of space activity can be used to improve many kinds of useful Earthly technology, and innovative space technologies can also be used directly to help to address many problems on Earth. I'm going to focus, however, on two distinct domains in which knowledge acquired from space activity is currently particularly relevant: medicine and defence. Space activity has contributed to medical knowledge since the days of the Space Race: it's well known that ""the first biomedical data intercepted from space"" was data recording the vital signs of the space dog, Laika (National Air and Space Museum, 2011); and Nilsson (2023) describes how the Apollo 11 astronauts ""wore ECG sensors throughout the trip"". In this context, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) explains how extreme conditions help with the development of personalised medicine, in the sense of helping to ""tail[or] pharmaceuticals and other treatments for optimal effectiveness for a patient's unique physiology"" (Balch, 2023). And Shirah and colleagues provide a useful overview of the breadth of medical advancement that has benefitted from space knowledge, including examples ranging from cooling treatments for joint treatments to improved CPR techniques and ""tissue chip"" experiments (Shirah et al., 2023). Similarly broad in range, NASA refers to progress in fields including dementia, asthma, cancer, and muscle protection, when discussing how ""researchers from around the world use the space station to address complex human health problems on Earth"" (NASA Space Station Research Integration Office, 2022). In 2024 the space biotech company Redwire used its BioFabrication Facility technology, based on the International Space Station, to 3D bioprint the ""the first live human heart tissue sample"" (Redwire, 2024). And there are hopes for further advancements: the AAMC describes a ""new golden age"" of space medicine, in which, ""to keep up with the demand for people with expertise in aerospace medicine, academic medicine institutions have expanded their programs to prepare clinicians for this burgeoning industry"" (Balch, 2023). The increasing incidence of private space flight is contributing to this, an academic medic at the Center for Space Medicine explains, not only because it expands space activity, but because ""[t]he private astronauts who go to space are more representative of the population on earth: older people, young people, folks with medical conditions, people from different countries"" (Balch, 2023). I'm now going to turn to two arguments focused on how space knowledge can bring about greater security on Earth – or even peace. First is a relative argument pertaining to the current international context. In his recent space policy primer, which offers ""an alternative proposition for why space matters to the UK"", Elefteriu (2024, p. 3) contends that the UK government should ""view space as central to national defence"", in the midst of the ""rapid deterioration of the international environment"" (2024, p. 5), and following a ""step-change in worldwide space capabilities"" (2024, p. 6). In this context, Elefteriu argues, increased investment in space activity is vital to making the nation secure against militaristic space threats (including alleged Russian plans for orbital nuclear weapons), as well as to pursuing strategic interests. This argument, however, implicitly emphasises that space is also being used for offensive purposes. This is nothing new: the UN has been actively concerned with maintaining peace in space since 1957 (UNODA, 2018); the Space Race was always, primarily, a military project. But the Space Foundation (2024) has calculated that, in 2023, global military space budgets grew 18 per cent on the previous year, totalling $57 billion, and comprising almost half of total government space expenditure. And Euroconsult, which published similar figures, claims that 2023 was the first year in which more was spent on these military budgets (which it calculates at $58 billion, and describes as ""defence expenditures"") than on civil programmes (Euroconsult, 2023). Moreover, as Wiedemar (2023, pp. 1, 2) chronicles, ever since the first ""integration of space-based assets into a military operation"" during the 1990–91 Gulf War, the ""militarization of commercial space assets"" has developed at a rapid rate, and is ""exemplified"" by the role these assets are playing in the Russia–Ukraine war. In this context, whilst space activity may be proving increasingly crucial to protecting national interests, this development reflects the growing exploitation of space for aggressive ends. The second argument is the more utopian contention that knowledge-based space-tech advances, in domains including observation and communications technology, could help to create conditions on Earth that are generally more conducive to peace. Central considerations here are ways in which improved access to reliable information could lead to fewer potentially catastrophic confusions, such as instances in which misunderstandings have almost led to the outbreak of nuclear wars (Sleight, 2016), and to greater accountability for power-holders committing wrongs, as seen in the case of satellite imagery proving the existence of the Chinese government's human rights-violating detention camps (Ruser, 2020). The value proposition here, therefore, is also largely focused on defence: that knowledge acquired in space will help to protect against, and ideally prevent, human aggression. Moreover, privacy concerns grow about increasingly invasive surveillance technology, and, whilst advances in communications technology can indeed help to reduce dangerous confusion, such advances also offer improved opportunities for collaboration between bad actors. In conclusion, whilst space knowledge holds much potential to further good ends on Earth – often offering privileged routes into doing so – the realisation of this potential will remain dependent on how such knowledge is used. Finally, I'm briefly going to discuss the non-human value of space activity. By this I mean the value of space activity to relevant non-human things, encompassing (a) non-human animals and other living things, such as plants and non-human extra-terrestrial life; and (b) natural resources, such as land, lakes, and the space vacuum itself. Much of what I've already discussed has relevance for the good of these non-human things. For instance, increased scientific knowledge can lead to advancements in veterinary medicine, as well as in the better surveillance and therefore protection of animal habitats, and in improvements for plant health and cultivation. And again, space profits and tax revenues can be spent on pursuing these good ends. But there are two further ideas that should also be taken into account when considering the value of space activity to these non-human things. The first is the idea that space activity, when done well, can improve humankind's capability to conserve natural resources, on Earth and in space. Arguments coalescing around this kind of idea typically conclude that engaging with, using, and owning certain kinds of resources can make those resources more productive and better protected against harms. These arguments are often associated with historic 'homesteading' practices, which were not without significant moral and other problems (e.g. for a summary of the wrongs done to Native Americans by homesteaders, see National Park Service, 2021). On a more general level, however, conservation arguments track a basic human urge to protect the natural resources we live amongst – particularly in and around the places we think of as home – not only because these resources hold instrumental value for us, in using them, but also because we accord other kinds of value to them, such as beauty, historical significance, and intrigue. A key objection to the conclusion that space activity could have important conservational benefits for natural resources in space, however, can be seen in the pressing problem of 'space junk'. As NASA (2023) bluntly puts it, ""[t]he space around our planet is filled with rubbish"". Inmarsat (2022, p. 5) claims that consequently ""the risk of catastrophic accidental collisions is increasingly high"". But space junk is not only hazardous to space activity and disadvantageous to astronomers; it also signifies a lack of respect for the environment. The existence of space junk doesn't necessarily defeat conservation arguments, however. Rather, it can be conceived as a free-rider problem, providing another reason for the urgent overhaul of space governance. The second further idea to consider, when assessing the value of space activity to relevant non-human things, is less tangible. This is the idea that space activity could, one day, enable humankind to welcome other forms of life into our community – if there is such life in space for us to engage with. That is, the discovery of extra-terrestrial life could prove valuable not only for us but also for the extra-terrestrials. We could share with them our technological and cultural achievements, our friendship, and other good things. There are of course risks to consider here, too: both for us, if extra-terrestrial life were to prove hostile; and for the extra-terrestrials, if through bad behaviour or insufficient knowledge we posed a threat to them. But it is hard to avoid the temptation of considering the value of human space activity to life in places beyond our planet – and it is through such activity that we might gain the opportunity to engage with such life, on our own terms.",Spaceflight effects on biology; Space Exploration and Technology; Technology Assessment and Management

I explain what Waltz might have meant by this, and how deep this professed Kantianism ran. Such is the depth of the engagement, I argue, that it is no exaggeration to claim that Waltz's political philosophy, his philosophy of history, his philosophy of science, his methodology, and his normative theory of anarchy are all broadly Kantian. Crucially, what Waltz meant by the ‘virtues of anarchy’, is best understood as an attempt to develop a regulative ideal, or an ‘organising principle’ of ‘practical reason’ that would guide diplomats in the nuclear age. Indeed, in his most contentious intervention in global public policy, Waltz deploys Kant to argue that horizontal nuclear spread, rather than the spread of democracy, would ensure the peaceful development of states. This anarchic nuclear peace would, he thought, be the means to achieve ‘perpetual pacification’. This revisionist reconstruction is the primary contribution of the paper. But through unsettling paradigmatic readings of ‘Waltzian IR theory’, the paper also presents an immanent critique of ‘the virtues of anarchy’ that contributes to a wider research project on the concept of anarchy and its emancipatory potential.",Hannah Arendt's Political Philosophy; Political Philosophy and Ethics; Critical Theory and Philosophy

Intergenerational psychology–specifically how people think about and care for future generations–has emerged as a critical driver of pro-environmental engagement, transcending demographic and ideological barriers. Insights from ethical philosophy, political philosophy, and behavioral economics further underscore the importance of intergenerational approaches in addressing environmental issues. We review the recent research on psychological interventions, legacy motivations, the principles of intergenerational responsibility, and behavior in economic games in the context of pro-environmental engagement. Broadly, this research has shown promise in promoting climate action across diverse populations through intergenerational framings. Importantly, intergenerational approaches not only inspire individual responsibility but also foster collective efforts toward sustainable solutions. Despite considerable emerging research, we point towards gaps in the literature for future research to address. Namely, there is a need for more research exploring the enduring impacts of intergenerational interventions using randomized controlled trials with longitudinal designs and examining their potential in promoting resilience and justice in the face of climate change. In sum, we conclude that addressing both climate change mitigation and adaptation through an intergenerational lens could be key to protecting the environment–not only for the present generation, but for the many future generations to come.",Psychological and Temporal Perspectives Research; Psychological Well-being and Life Satisfaction

Highlighting the recent Al-Aqsa Flood operation led by Hamas and the subsequent violence inflicted by Israel, the study reveals how these events have renewed international scrutiny of Zionism and its influence. Christian Zionists, integral to the broader pro-Israeli lobby in the USA, leverage their theological beliefs, rooted in dispensationalist interpretations, to support Israeli policies. Their influence, though significant, is not without limits. Despite their opposition to a two-state solution and efforts to block peace initiatives like the Oslo Accords and the Wye River Memorandum, the USA administration has occasionally pursued policies contrary to their wishes. This article argues that Christian Zionism is not a conspiracy theory but a substantial factor in shaping the USA support for Israel, driven by theological motivations rather than genuine affection for Jewish people. The study emphasizes the need for further research to understand the broader network of pro-Israeli actors and concludes that the Bible's influence on Anglo-American culture will likely continue to support Israel, despite its human rights violations.","Jewish and Middle Eastern Studies; Religion and Society Interactions; Religion, Society, and Development"

Bilgi kirliliği ve manipülasyonun her geçen gün arttığı günümüzde, müziğin toplumsal eleştiri aracı olarak işlevinin ortaya konulması doğrultusunda, bu çalışma kapsamında Baltimore, Maryland çıkışlı bir metal müzik grubu olan Misery Index’in 2019 yılında yayınlanan ""Rituals of Power"" albümünün metinsel içeriğinde post-truth olgusunun inşa ve aktarım biçimlerinin açığa çıkarılarak yorumlanması amaçlanmıştır. Niteliksel içerik çözümlemesi yaklaşımı benimsenerek gerçekleştirilen çalışmada albümdeki şarkı sözleri, MAXQDA Analytics Pro 2024 programına aktarıldıktan sonra sistematik ve tümevarımsal bir şekilde kodlanmış ve “medya ve siyaset”, “toplumsal çöküş”, “toplumsal baskı ve dışlanma” ve “iktidarın döngüsel doğası” olmak üzere dört tema çerçevesinde yorumlanmıştır. Bulgular, albümde çarpıtılmış gerçeklik, kurumsal başarısızlık ve bilginin kasıtlı manipülasyonu ile mücadelenin söz konusu olduğu bir dünyanın karanlık bir tasvirinin sunulduğunu göstermektedir. Bu bağlamda şarkı sözleri; medya manipülasyonu, yankı odaları, politik aldatma, gerçek ve kurgu arasındaki çizginin bulanıklaşması, toplumsal çöküş, ahlaki yozlaşma, distopik gelecek ve kurumlara duyulan güvenin kaybı gibi post-truth olgusuyla ilişkili konuları ele almaktadır. Post-truth çağının beraberinde getirdiği sorunlara sanatsal bir yanıt niteliği taşıyan albüm, dinleyicileri bu sorunlar konusunda bilinçlendirerek eleştirel düşünmeye teşvik etmektedir. Müzik ve toplumsal yapı arasındaki çok yönlü ilişkinin disiplinlerarası bir bakış açısıyla incelendiği bu çalışma, müziğin güncel sosyopolitik konuları sorgulayarak dinleyicilere aktarma potansiyelini vurgulamakta ve post-truth olgusunun sanatsal ifadeler üzerindeki etkisine dair anlayışımızı genişletmektedir.",Misinformation and Its Impacts; Media Influence and Health; Media Studies and Communication

It begins by defining the concept of collapse and uses historian Jared Diamond’s perspective to analyze how internal strife, such as loss of cultural identity, conflicting ideologies, and political division, can initiate the decline of a civilization due to a fragmentation of social solidarity. The essay then uses historical examples of the Islamic and Roman Empires to illustrate the importance of social solidarity for the survival of civilizations. It also discusses the internal challenges faced by modern civilization, including issues brought about by globalization, political polarization, East-West conflicts, global supply chain shortages, and how these factors can erode solidarity, posing a risk of collapse to the contemporary “world civilization.” The essay concludes by highlighting that internal conflicts and the absence of social solidarity are the primary causes of civilizational collapse, a theory that remains relevant for understanding the challenges faced by the global civilization today.",World Systems and Global Transformations; Political Economy and Marxism

We question if data at the city level necessarily can lead to conclusions at the civilization level. More specifically, we suggest ways in which learnings from research, foresight, diversity and effective future government might act outside of their model to regulate super-linear growth curves of civilizations, and thus substantively increase the likelihood of civilizations progressing towards higher levels of the Kardashev scale. Moreover, we believe their claimed history of the collapse of terrestrial societies used to evidence their model is difficult to justify. Overall, we cast reasonable doubt on the ability of their proposed model to satisfactorily explain the Fermi paradox.",Complex Systems and Time Series Analysis; Evolutionary Game Theory and Cooperation; World Systems and Global Transformations

If so, why did civilization collapse? With the worldwide pandemic ending and the remaining ripples still visible today, one can't help but wonder how much more catastrophic our civilization can withstand before it collapses. The lessons of history help modern people predict the future of our civilization. This article delves into the multiple reasons behind the collapse of civilizations, including military invasions, political instability, and environmental concerns. Through the analysis of historical cases, the article reveals how these factors interact and ultimately lead to the decline of civilization. In addition, environmental issues such as climate change and ecological destruction have also played a vital role in the collapse of civilizations. Dramatic changes in population numbers are essential precursors of civilizations' collapse; whether due to military conflict, alien invasion, or natural disasters, population decline will weaken the viability of civilizations. The article also highlights the global trend of slow population decline as a potential threat to the future of civilization. The low fertility trap is widespread in many countries, accelerating aging societies, labor shortages, increasing pressure on social security, and weakening economic growth momentum. The cases of China, South Korea, Japan, and other countries show that this trend, once formed, is difficult to reverse and constitutes a profound warning for the future of human civilization.",World Systems and Global Transformations

However, with the loss of socio-political complexity, the decline in population size, and the impact of economic systems, civilizations will collapse and eventually be lost. Therefore, this essay explores the causes of civilization collapse and civilization threats from both political and environmental aspects and analyzes the potential threats of these factors to modern society through historical cases. This issue argues that political factors such as external invasions and civil wars led to the collapse of civilizations, such as the victory of the Seljuks and the migration of Turkey. Environmental conditions such as ecological imbalances, resource depletion, and climate change can also lead to the collapse of civilizations, such as the decline of the ancient Maya and ancient Egypt. In modern society, political conflicts and environmental problems continue to threaten civilization. Political controversy and the notion of a naturalized state affect international relations. Extreme weather events, such as storms and floods, triggered by climate change, cause agricultural, economic, and social damage, leading to large-scale migration. Therefore, modern people should always think critically and change occasionally.",Regional Socio-Economic Development Trends

Robertson,,True,green,https://osf.io/z3hn4/download,"Previous research on correlates of the Social Progress Index in U.S. states was replicated among 100 countries where data is available. A multiple regression analysis indicates that social progress is correlated strongly to gross domestic product per capita divided by the cost of living and higher scores on a democracy index. Religious commitment, indicated by surveys of daily prayer, is correlated to less social progress. The research literature suggests that religious commitment leads to neglect of the prevention and treatment of diseases and injuries recommended by science, disdain for scientists, and acquiescence to or support of autocratic government. The trend toward autocracy in several democracies may lead to the deterioration of social progress. Increased global warming and the threat of nuclear winter depend disproportionately on the behavior of autocratic leaders in China, Russia, and the U.S. that neglect or deny the need to curb fossil use and express intent to expand their nuclear arsenals.","Religion, Society, and Development; Religion and Society Interactions; Islamic Finance and Banking Studies"
