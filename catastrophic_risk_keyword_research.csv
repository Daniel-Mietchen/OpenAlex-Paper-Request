This challenge is particularly acute for countries with existing debt issues, which often rely on slow and uncertain foreign aid whose terms are typically agreed upon only ex-post. In contrast, ex-ante financial instruments, such as insurance and sovereign catastrophe risk pools, offer faster, more predictable funding while encouraging risk reduction and adaptation investments.Sovereign risk pools, such as the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF), African Risk Capacity (ARC), and Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative (PCRAFI), have proven valuable. However, they may not fully realize their financial resilience potential, as pooling within the same region can limit risk diversification. This presentation will introduce a method to design risk pools by maximizing diversification across countries regardless of region. Results show this approach consistently enhances risk diversification, more evenly distributes risk shares within the pool, and increases the number of benefiting countries.Related publication:Ciullo, A., Strobl, E., Meiler, S.&amp;#160;et al.&amp;#160;Increasing countries&amp;#8217; financial resilience through global catastrophe risk pooling.&amp;#160;Nat Commun&amp;#160;14, 922 (2023). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-36539-4",Insurance and Financial Risk Management; Agricultural risk and resilience

This article presents the state of the field on interventions to maintain food production in these scenarios, aiming to prevent mass starvation and reduce the chance of civilizational collapse and potential existential catastrophe. The potential for rapid scaling, affordability, and large-scale deployment is reviewed for a portfolio of food production methods over land, water, and industrial systems. Special focus is given to proposing avenues for further research and technology development and to collating policy proposals. Maintaining international trade and prioritizing crops for food instead of animal feed or biofuels is paramount. Both mature, proven methods (crop relocation, plant-residue- and grass–fed ruminants, greenhouses, seaweed, fishing, etc.) and novel resilient foods are characterized. A future research agenda is outlined, including scenario characterization, policy development, production ramp-up and economic analyses, and rapid deployment trials. Governments could implement national plans and task forces to address extreme food system risks, and invest in resilient food solutions to safeguard citizens against global catastrophic food failure.","Nuclear Issues and Defense; Environmental, Ecological, and Cultural Studies; Nuclear and radioactivity studies"

In this study, we introduce a quantitative network model of global financial cascading failure.

In this article, I explore the case for long‐term liberalism: freedom should be a central goal, and we should often be particularly concerned with effects on long‐term future distributions of freedom. I provide three arguments. First, liberals should be long‐term liberals: liberal arguments to value freedom give us reason to be (particularly) concerned with future freedom, including freedom in the far future. Second, longtermists should be liberals, particularly under conditions of empirical and moral uncertainty. Third, long‐term liberalism plausibly justifies some restrictions on the freedom of existing people to secure the freedom of future people, for example when mitigating climate change. At the same time, it likely avoids excessive trade‐offs: for both empirical and philosophical reasons, long‐term and near‐term freedom show significant convergence. Throughout I also highlight important practical implications, for example on longtermist institutional action, climate change, human extinction, demography, and global catastrophic risks.",Climate Change and Geoengineering

Major shocks can arise from global catastrophic risks, such as abrupt sunlight reduction scenarios (e.g., nuclear war) or global catastrophic infrastructure loss (e.g., due to severe geomagnetic storms or a global pandemic). We use a network model to examine how these two scenarios could impact global food trade, focusing on wheat, maize, soybeans, and rice, accounting for about 60% of global calorie intake. Our findings indicate that an abrupt sunlight reduction scenario, with soot emissions equivalent to a major nuclear war between India and Pakistan (37 Tg), could severely disrupt trade, causing most countries to lose the vast majority of their food imports (50-100 % decrease), primarily due to the main exporting countries being heavily affected. Global catastrophic infrastructure loss of the same magnitude as the abrupt sunlight reduction has a more homogeneous distribution of yield declines, resulting in most countries losing up to half of their food imports (25-50 % decrease). Thus, our analysis shows that both scenarios could significantly impact the food trade. However, the abrupt sunlight reduction scenario is likely more disruptive than global catastrophic infrastructure loss regarding the effects of yield reductions on food trade.

This paper examines two common concerns: that genetic enhancement may create biologically distinct “superhumans” who might outcompete ordinary humans or cause a societal collapse, and that modifying the human genome might “disrupt human nature”, leading to the loss of our humanness. While these concerns appear distinct, both ultimately fear that genome editing may create individuals who can no longer be identified as “human” endangering humanity as we know it, and thus both view genome editing as an existential threat. This paper critically evaluates these concerns by examining the feasibility of the envisioned scenarios, arguing that the emergence of a distinct superhuman species is highly unlikely as it would require reproductive isolation achievable only through strictly controlled reproduction, while the emergence of people with enhanced traits might not necessarily convert into a societal catastrophe. Likewise, human nature is unlikely to be fundamentally altered by genome editing without extreme reproductive control, while the genome alone does not define human nature that has significantly evolved throughout human history. Since both feared scenarios would require a dystopian level of reproductive control rather than the mere availability of genome editing, I conclude by discussing the use of extreme totalitarian scenarios in guiding genome editing policy. This paper contributes to the debate on human genetic enhancement by challenging two common existential concerns and advocating for evidence-based ethical and policy deliberations.","Geographies of human-animal interactions; Race, Genetics, and Society; Space Science and Extraterrestrial Life"

Patil; Stefan Hochrainer‐Stigler,,False,closed,,"Despite wide-spread recognition and rhetoric regarding the burdens imposed by simple and systemic disaster and climate risks as well as solid evidence regarding the benefits of reducing risk, it has remained difficult to motivate sustained investment into disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA) at individual project level as well as country scale. To this effect, international policy debate over the last years in the wake of the international compacts of 2015 has emphasized the need for orienting such investments toward interventions that generate so-called triple or multiple resilience dividends. Such dividends include reducing loss of lives and livelihoods, unlocking development, and creating development co-benefits. In addition to risk reduction benefits from project investment (1st dividend), these suggested dividends would arise from positive externalities, such as unlocked development (2nd dividend) and co-benefits (3rd dividend), e.g. investment into health systems with returns from treating disaster-affected patients and those affected by idiosyncratic events, such as from disease or accidents. In economic parlance, externalities (also called spill-overs) can be considered the benefits (if positive) or costs (if negative) not directly captured in market prices or transactions. In our discussion, we consider externalities as the unplanned positive or negative effects arising from risk management investment. While externalities have been considered in sustainability decision-making for public sector investment decisions for many issues, in DRR and CCA they are generally not yet well captured, which gave rise to the concept of triple dividend decision-making propositions.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;Yet, while triple and multi resilience dividend decision-making have received attention in policy and practice over the last decade, evidence remains scarce, particularly as to the 2nd dividend (the externalities).

The System Dynamics (SD) community has spent decades examining the complexity of global issues and responding to the ensuing risks—from the limits to growth (Herrington, 2021; Nature, 2022) and climate change (Rooney-Varga et al., 2021; Sterman, 2008) to the opioid crises (Jalali et al., 2020; Nataraj et al., 2024), poverty (Herrera de Leon & Kopainsky, 2019), and violent conflicts (Clancy et al., 2024). However, today's crises feel different. What has changed? The answer lies in the emergence of what scholars today call the polycrisis. At the core of the concept is the intuition that what may appear to be separate crises in different systems in fact interact and reshape one another in ways that compound their harms yet remain underappreciated in policy and analysis. Definitions vary (see Matlovič & Matlovičová, 2024), but virtually all of them adopt a systems perspective as the essential foundation of the concept. Polycrisis thinkers maintain that the polycrisis as a whole is both different, and generally worse, than the sum of its constituent crises, thus constituting an emergent phenomenon (e.g., World Economic Forum, 2023). They recognize the interactions between multiple causes working in complex patterns (such as feedback loops) to generate crises, while others continue to offer reductionist explanations (e.g., Tooze, 2022). And polycrisis thinkers emphasize nonlinear dynamics and unpredictability of the systems in which crises occur—properties that defy conventional risk analysis and traditional policymaking approaches (Davies & Hobson, 2023). One particular approach understands a crisis as the harmful disequilibrium that occurs when long-term stresses and more proximate trigger interact to push a system out of its established basin of attraction (Lawrence, Homer-Dixon, Janzwood, et al., 2024). The resonance of polycrisis thinking with the SD community's concerns is readily evident. To pursue these intersections would not just seize a promising opportunity, it is an urgent imperative that could help the world navigate the world's precarious and unprecedented condition (Homer-Dixon, 2023). To aid the collaboration, members of the polycrisis community set out a productive, practicable, and stimulating agenda for research and action in May 2024. Many of the priorities articulated in Polycrisis Research and Action Roadmap can and should be taken up by the SD community (the roadmap is co-authored by the Cascade Institute, the Potsdam Institute for Climate Action Research (PIK), the Research Institute for Sustainability/Helmholtz Centre Potsdam, and the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk (CSER) at Cambridge University) (Lawrence, Shipman, et al., 2024). First, in terms of theoretical foundations, researchers and practitioners should be more explicit about their positions about the nature of the polycrisis, the level of crises' interactions sufficient to qualify as a polycrisis and the concepts of risk and crisis (SD has a deep-rooted epistemology based on operationalizing and making mental models explicit). Second, regarding empirical research, there is a compelling call to more clearly identify the systems under investigation and the boundaries of those systems, along with the mechanisms behind crisis spread and contagion (the tools and approaches within the SD community have largely debated the boundaries of models and diffusion mechanisms in several fields). Third, as for practical applications, policymakers and other frontline stakeholders are excluded from the polycrisis research process, often as the result of a ""negativity bias"" within the field that limits reach (SD has long been applied to understand and address wicked problems with a perceived strong ""negative"" bias and the SD community has developed many innovative group-based and participatory modeling processes). Fourth, in terms of community building, the development of a polycrisis field requires a unified identity that represents diverse perspectives and fosters cooperation, along with the organizational infrastructure to support communication and collaboration (the SD community sets an excellent benchmark with the System Dynamics Society and the System Dynamics Review). With those four dimensions in mind, we put forth a set of five key features of the overarching SD approach and academic community that makes it uniquely positioned to make significant contributions to the emerging field of polycrisis analysis. One approach to polycrisis analysis is the stress–trigger–crisis (STC) model, where slow-moving systemic stresses (e.g., climate change or socioeconomic inequality) interact with fast-moving trigger events (e.g., financial collapses or pandemics) to push global systems into disequilibrium (Lawrence, Shipman, & Homer-Dixon, 2024). What makes polycrisis particularly dangerous is the feedback loops between these stresses and trigger events. For instance, a pandemic might worsen socioeconomic inequality, which in turn undermines public health systems, creating conditions for future health crises. These feedback loops can be explained by modeling how crises in one system can intensify or trigger crises in others based on a fundamental ""endogenous point of view"", which George Richardson calls the sine qua non of systems approaches (Richardson, 2011). SD can offer critical insights into how we might break dangerous loops of crisis amplification and develop more resilient systems. The unpredictability of polycrisis is one of its defining features, as the precise timing and location of trigger events are difficult to forecast. Within this context, SD offers tools to support scenario analysis, allowing us to simulate how different patterns of behavior might emerge. Inter-systemic feedback diagrams (Lawrence, Shipman, & Homer-Dixon, 2024), for example, depict how stressors in one domain, such as climate heating, can lead to cascading effects in other domains, such as pandemics and economic crises. The SD community can then further provide decision-makers with tools to anticipate and mitigate the potential impacts of future crises. This type of scenario analysis is essential for policymakers trying to navigate a world of profound uncertainty. Polycrisis analysis is inherently interdisciplinary, requiring insights from fields as diverse as environmental science, political economy, public health, and international relations. One of the strengths of SD is its ability to integrate knowledge from multiple domains into coherent models. SD can support the development of comprehensive models that capture the interactions between various systems in crisis. For example, the STC model emphasizes how systemic stresses slowly erode a system's equilibrium, while trigger events push the system into disequilibrium. As system dynamicists, we can play a vital role in refining these models, using our tools to better map out the complex causal pathways that define the polycrisis. A key challenge of polycrisis analysis is the sheer complexity of the interactions between crises. Policymakers, faced with a flood of data and (mis)information, often struggle to entirely grasp the full extent of the interconnections between crises in different systems. This is where SD can provide decision support tools, helping policymakers understand how interventions in one system might ripple through others, producing unintended consequences. The domino diagrams used to map the intersection between systemic risks in recent polycrisis analysis (see Lawrence, Shipman, & Homer-Dixon, 2024) offer a powerful metaphor, as they illustrate how a trigger event in one system (e.g., a spike in energy prices) can cause cascading failures across others (e.g., food shortages, economic instability). SD models can extend these metaphors, offering policymakers tangible simulations of how actions seemingly focusing on one area—such as implementing climate policies or regulating financial markets—can have wide-ranging impacts. We can make use of our long tradition of management flight simulators and serious games, such as the En-ROADS global climate simulator, to respond to these demands (Kapmeier et al., 2021). Finally, as polycrisis typically pushes systems into states of disequilibrium, the system's usual feedback mechanisms might break down or change nature, leading to unpredictable and potentially catastrophic outcomes. SD can help map out the possible transitions back to stability, identifying pathways that minimize harm. When systems are forced out of equilibrium, they may enter periods of volatility and disruption, frequently resulting in cascading harms. SD models can offer insights into how we might navigate these periods of disequilibrium, by identifying the leverage and intervention points that can either stabilize the system or push it into a new, more sustainable equilibrium. The polycrisis is here, and the SD community has the tools to make a difference. By embracing polycrisis analysis, we can extend our tradition of tackling the world's most pressing challenges and contribute to building a more resilient, just, and sustainable global system.

Dixson,,True,hybrid,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11569-024-00465-6,"Abstract There can be a temptation to dismiss moral pushback against novel science and technology, particularly commonplace labels for nanotechnology and synthetic biology like “playing God” or “messing with nature"". One of the reasons for this is an implicit association between tragic themes and a lack of constructive benefit. Therefore, this paper uses concepts from art and cinema to offer a new perspective on public ""fears"": ecstatic reframing. By treating negative narratives not as roadblocks to progress, but portals into latent dreams, this novel method reframes such views as housing a positive vision. However, while this offers a new approach regarding public talk of emerging science and technology, lay ethics is ultimately insufficient to deal with the underlying problems that stimulate their tragic tone. This paper uses a classic concept from anthropology--rites of passage--to argue that public unease is fundamentally cultural: modernity's lack of a collectively agreed upon worldview and primordial ritual structure for stewarding change. This ""cultural deficit"" may lie at the core of tragic narratives regarding emerging science and technology.","Climate Change Communication and Perception; Innovation, Sustainability, Human-Machine Systems"

In this study, we develop and investigate a discrete-time version of the Basener and Ross model. First, the existence and the stability of fixed points for the present model are investigated. Next, we investigated various bifurcation scenarios by establishing criteria for the occurrence of different types of codimension-one bifurcations, including flip and Neimark–Sacker bifurcations. These criteria are derived using the center manifold theorem and bifurcation theory. Furthermore, we demonstrated the existence of codimension-two bifurcations characterized by 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4 resonances, emphasizing the model’s complex dynamical structure. Numerical simulations are employed to validate and illustrate the theoretical predictions. Finally, through bifurcation diagrams, maximal Lyapunov exponents, and phase portraits, we uncover a diversity of dynamical characteristics, including limit cycles, periodic solutions, and chaotic attractors.",Mathematical and Theoretical Epidemiology and Ecology Models; Evolution and Genetic Dynamics; Plant and animal studies

I argue that identity dissolution reinforces social stratifications while co-opting the rhetoric of cooperation. I provide the metaphor of the boat, rather than serving as a symbol of refuge, embodies entrenched social hierarchies, from the environmental normativity inherent in Malthusian lifeboat ethics to various depictions in climate fiction (cli-fi) and eco-fascist rhetoric.

However, since video games are an interactive medium and the most common-sensical view of history is that the past is fixed, it is clear that, at least from a representationalist point of view, there is some unresolved tension. The article explores this predicament and draws heavily from contemporary historical non-representationalism – a position that shifts focus from the idea of representing the real past to the close examination of historical discourse as a complex argumentative practice, relying on evidence and robust theoretical background. To complement the theoretical examination of the problem, the paper examines three examples from historical discourse (the Late Bronze Age collapse, cliodynamics, and Big History) and juxtaposes them against two examples of historical video games of a strategic genre that deal with related topics. It is argued that what makes video games historical is their complex relation to the ongoing historical discourse.",Digital Games and Media; Digital Humanities and Scholarship

Refusal, which is presented here as a form of constructive defiance, in fact proves to be just as relevant for this purpose, particularly when it comes to understanding collective actions that are non-confrontational but express a critique of the order of things. This is what the ethnography of utopian collectives established in the French countryside tends to show. The women and men who compose them, individually driven by the desire to ‘no longer play the game’, slip collectively, on certain occasions, into the interstices of the social order, acting together in order to refuse certain of its social, political and economic norms. Their ways of doing things and the social relationships they then form can prefigure certain features of a ‘different future’.","French Urban and Social Studies; Education, sociology, and vocational training; Aging, Elder Care, and Social Issues"

This paper examines Germany's foreclosure of reparation claims raised by descendants of survivors of its 1904–8 colonial genocide. The analysis draws on parliamentary interpellation records (1989–2021) around the question of German reparations to Namibia's Ovaherero and Nama. I argue that Germany mobilizes temporal rules of international law, especially the non-retroactivity of the Genocide Convention, to deflect from such claims. This strategy first confines the political question of colonial reparations to the international legal realm, only to then invalidate it via the temporal rule of law's non-retroactivity. I argue that this strategy enables a ‘chronopolitics of deflection’, by which Germany has pointed away from colonial reparations while directing attention to development assistance payments to Namibia. The paper relates these findings to theories of political time, arguing that Germany's reliance on the non-retroactivity of the Genocide Convention yields what I call a ‘projection of history as normatively temporalized time’. The paper concludes with critiques of the relationship between international law and colonial reparations, arguing that current invocations of inter-temporal and non-retroactive international law implicitly reiterate colonial law, thereby locking in place an unjust legal past.",International Law and Human Rights; Historical and Contemporary Political Dynamics; Global Peace and Security Dynamics

However, in a recent book his thoughts take a striking new turn. Appealing to our epistemic competencies, he argues, will not suffice to meet the skeptical challenge to our claim to have knowledge of the world around us. We must recognize that our epistemic competencies are exercised against a background of “proper default assumptions”: commitments concerning the world and our place in it that we cannot justify but can rely on without incurring epistemic fault. Sosa finds anticipations of this idea in Wittgenstein’s appeal to propositions “hinge” propositions which, though not known, “stand fast”. However, mere fast-standing beliefs, “unhinged from any broader virtue epistemology”, cannot explain how we come to have knowledge of a world whose character is independent of what we happen to think about it. I argue that the claim that our everyday knowledge of the world rests on a body of assumptions is a serious concession to skepticism, which Wittgenstein shows we need not make. Hinge propositions are not mere “standfast” beliefs: they are known with certainty. Wittgenstein offers a way of thinking about knowledge that Sosa does not consider. He also poses a challenge to commonly held views about how epistemology, to the extent that there is such a subject, should be pursued.","Epistemology, Ethics, and Metaphysics; Philosophy and Theoretical Science; Wittgensteinian philosophy and applications"

The findings indicate similarities and differences in the Gothic lexicon of the two languages, influenced by unique historical and cultural developments. English Gothic lexemes embody themes of autonomy, enigma, and existential dread, whereas their Uzbek equivalents are interwoven with folklore and spiritual elements, highlighting communal experiences and moral dichotomies. These results emphasize the versatility of Gothic aesthetics across countries, providing fresh perspectives on cross-cultural literary and linguistic studies.","Swearing, Euphemism, Multilingualism; Linguistics, Language Diversity, and Identity; Lexicography and Language Studies"

Using perspectives informed by hauntology and monster theory, I contend that educators can benefit from these conceptual frameworks. Hauntology is a philosophical concept introduced by Jacques Derrida, focusing on the idea of the persistence of the past within the present and the impact of forgotten or repressed histories on contemporary culture. It explores how the «spectres» of past events and ideologies continue to influence and haunt current social and cultural contexts. Monster theory, on the other hand, is a framework developed by Jeffrey Jerome Cohen that examines how monsters in literature and folklore serve as symbols for societal anxieties and cultural conflicts. It interprets monsters as embodiments of societal fears, otherness, and transgressions, bringing to light key elements of cultural norms and human psychology. Both present viewpoints on looking into how the past and cultural anxieties shape our present realities. The discussion in this paper includes pedagogical tools that address transgender experiences, such as the seven facets of Socratic seminars designed to foster conversations on cosmopolitan ideals of diversity. Additionally, the value of guiding students to consistently question «who, where, and why» is emphasised, with a focus on how a monstrous lens can contribute to the enhancement of developmental learning experiences. This article addresses both educators and enthusiasts of gender perspectives, advocating for teaching environments that enable students to explore a world beyond societal expectations. It also appeals to those interested in hauntology and monstrous lens theory, encouraging the integration of these theories to advance educational development.","Shakespeare, Adaptation, and Literary Criticism; Media Influence and Health; Rhetoric and Communication Studies"

By integrating a framework developed by linguist Ray Jackendoff to describe the experience of language with the study of danger in International Relations, and by employing an interpretive textual analysis technique to danger descriptions made by world leaders embedded in different historical and cultural settings constructing different security dangers, I develop and illustrate the ‘danger framework’. In describing the unique features with which leaders experience security dangers, the danger framework theorises the qualia of danger experience and how it is organised into the conscious field of leaders. In doing so, the paper makes progress on three problems for existing accounts of threat perception in IR, illuminates important research puzzles, and provides the literature on experience and Ontological Security Studies (OSS) with micro-foundations.","Leadership, Courage, and Heroism Studies"

Western disturbances (WDs) are synoptic-scale weather systems embedded within the subtropical westerly jet. Manifesting as upper-level troughs often associated with a lower-tropospheric low over western or northern India, they share some dynamical features with extratropical cyclones. WDs are most common during the boreal winter (December to March), during which they bring the majority of precipitation – both rain and snow – to the western Himalaya, as well as to surrounding areas of north India, Pakistan, and the Tibetan Plateau. WDs are also associated with weather hazards such as heavy snowfall, hailstorms, fog, cloudbursts, avalanches, frost, and cold waves. In this paper, we review recent developments in understanding WDs and their impacts. Over the last decade, recent studies have collectively made use of novel data, novel analysis techniques such as tracking algorithms, and the increasing availability of high-resolution weather and climate models. This review is separated into six main sections – structure and thermodynamics, precipitation and impacts, teleconnections, modelling experiments, forecasting at a range of scales, and paleoclimate and climate change – each motivated with a brief discussion of the accomplishments and limitations of previous research. A number of step changes in understanding are synthesised. Use of new modelling frameworks and tracking algorithms has significantly improved knowledge of WD structure and variability, and a more frequentist approach can now be taken. Improved observation systems have helped quantification of water security over the western Himalaya. Convection-permitting models have improved our understanding of how WDs interact with the Himalaya to trigger natural hazards. Improvements in paleoclimate and future climate modelling experiments have helped to explain how WDs and their impacts over the Himalaya respond to large-scale natural and anthropogenic forcings. We end by summarising unresolved questions and outlining key future WD research topics.",Climate variability and models; Cryospheric studies and observations; Meteorological Phenomena and Simulations
